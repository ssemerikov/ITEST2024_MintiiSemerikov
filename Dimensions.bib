 abstract = {Educationists and researchers recommend integration of simulations in classrooms to promote student-centric constructivist learning. The simulations need to be carefully designed toward improvement ofconceptual understanding of students. In this paper, we report on a training workshop for teachers with the specific goal of imparting simulation integration skills for classroom teaching. In the workshop, we used SEQUEL, a freely downloadable circuit simulator, and focused on electronic circuits taught typically at the second-year undergraduate level. We applied education technology principles as well as constructivist alignment methods to design the workshop. In particular, collaborative learning strategies such as think-pair-share and peer instruction were covered specifically for the intended simulation integration. Furthermore, application of the flippedclassroom model in the context of circuit simulation was explained to the participants. We report on the workshop design in detail and report the impact of the training  workshop on integration skills of the teachers. We found that teachers (N=15) perceived the workshop to be usefulin designing their aligned lesson plans. Teachers also reported their field study in which they found improved motivation of students to solve  electronics circuit problems.},

 abstract = {During the third millennium the humanity faced the multilevel problems. Their solutions require specialists with new level of thinking. All the attempts to solve these problems on transdisciplinary level do not give the appropriate result, because usually specialists don’t go further beyond the boundaries of their subject areas. Since 1970 the transdisc pi inary approach has been developed, within the framework of which the scientific worldview is expanding, and problems are considered at several levels simultaneously without limitation, by the limits of any one scientific discipline. However, the methods of transdisciplinary competences forming in specialists still remain unclear. The authors suggested the usage of a group “circle” approach in the training of practicing doctors and interns, who are trained at the stages of postgraduate medical education and continuous professional development. The condition of pedagogical technology is that experts (lecturers) from different subject areas and trainees (doctors-specialists), collaborate while solving the problems. Within the “circle” the situation is analyzed on the physical, legal and psy chological levels and the search for the most optimal solutions is performed. At the same time, doctors, Methodists, lawyers and psychologists create a common, transdisciplinary space that provides self-learning and mutual learning of all the participants. As a result: 1) The technology of group induing ‘circle method ’ is offered ai joint paroopanoo of experts of a different profile: 2) In the course of the wort participants significant expanded the horizons of their own knowledge: 3) The acquired skills enabled specialists to use the group meth­od subsequently for integrating cognitive spaces and finding the causes of emerging problems at different levels.},

Accessing continuing professional development is one of those challenges and is related to retention of workforce. Effectiveness of distance learning strategies for continuing professional development in rural allied healthcare workers has not been evaluated.MethodsWe searched 17 databases and the grey literature up to September 2016 following the PRISMA guidelines. Any primary studies were included that focussed on allied health and distance delivery regardless of education topic or study design. Two independent reviewers extracted data and critically appraised the selected studies.ResultsThe search returned 5257 results. With removal of duplicate references, we reviewed 3964 article titles and abstracts; n = 206 appeared potentially eligible and were scrutinised via full text screening; n = 14 were included. Studies were published between 1997 and 2016, were of varied methodological quality and were predominantly from Australia, USA and Canada with a focus on satisfaction of learners with the delivery method or on measures of educational outcomes. Technologies used to deliver distance education included video conference, teleconference, web based platforms and virtual reality. Early papers tended to focus more on the technology characteristics than educational outcomes. Some studies compared technology based delivery to face to face modes and found satisfaction and learning outcomes to be on par. Only three studies reported on practice change following the educational intervention and, despite a suggestion there is a link between the constructs, none measured the relationship between access to continuing professional development and workforce retention.ConclusionTechnology based options of delivery have a high utility, however the complex inter-relatedness of time, use, travel, location, costs, interactivity, learning outcomes and educational design suggest a need for more sophisticated consideration by educational providers.Trial registrationRegistration with PROSPERO 30 June 2016: CRD42016041588.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present the results of a comparative analysis of the two courses taught at teacher training institutions in Denmark and Croatia through which students are prepared to teach science at primary schools, namely the course on Nature and Techniques taught in Denmark and the course on Teaching Science taught in Croatia. Science is one of the most complex subjects to teach in primary schools and one of the most demanding subjects at teacher training faculties, in general. The analysis encompassed the characteristics of public education systems in both countries, the content of the courses and the specificities of the teacher pre-service training to implement this subject, with emphasis on competences required to teach them in primary schools. The analysis of teacher training curricula yielded that Teaching Science poorly prepares Croatian future teachers for participating in scientific research, establishing contacts with the representatives of local community, as well as for lifelong learning. Having in mind that, in democratic societies based on knowledge and participation, teachers are expected to develop in their students the skills for inquiry, communication and intellectual growth throughout their lives, the question emerges on how they could fulfil their professional tasks if teacher training faculties fail to properly prepare them before they enter schools.},

It gives an overviewof the different models of competencies in witch, by the developed IT skills and informationliteracy, there are also a wider competencies such as, for example, those of communication,cooperation, competence for creative and critical thinking and problem solving, etc. Specialattention is devoted to the identification of recent students’ and teachers’ skills and competenciesthat support teaching and learning and that are further developing through the contemporaryopen class. For teachers, to be able to effectively integrate ICT in class process of learning andteaching, it is necessary that they have built two types of skills and competencies: at least thebasic skills of information literacy and multimedia didactic competencies. While teachers candevelop the basic technological skills through the common computer courses for the generalpublic, building multimedia didactic competence requires specialized teachers’ training, which isgeared towards the specific methods of ICT use in teaching. Competences represent a dynamicphenomenon caused by the characteristics of a particular context and variable over time, so it isvitally to continuously reflect on the skills and competencies necessary for life in the 21st century.},

 abstract = {Aim/Purpose: IStation is an adaptive computer-based reading program that adapts to the learner’s academic needs. This study investigates if the Istation computer-based reading program promotes reading improvement scores as shown on the STAR Reading test and the IStation test scaled scores for elementary school third-grade learners on different reading levels. 

Background: Prior literature provided a limited evidence base for incorporating computer-adaptive learning technologies to improve reading comprehension in the con-text of early childhood education.

Methodology: Using a mixed-method case study research approach, this study purports to investigate the effects of IStation and examine the perspectives of teachers and students. Supported by survey and interview data, this case study employed a sample of 98 public school third-grade students in an urban elementary school in the southeastern United States as well as the three classroom teachers.

Contribution: This study has provided a) additional data to show evidence for the effectiveness of a computer-based reading program, IStation, by using the students’ and teachers’ viewpoints as well as reading comprehension test scores data; and b) recommendations for practitioners and researchers regarding professional development for IStation implementation.

Findings: The results of this study show a strong correlation between the usage of IStation and the rise of STAR reading scores during the time IStation was integrated. There were differing opinions regarding the effectiveness of IStation between students and teachers, as well as between low and high achieving students. Teachers recognized that intervening variables of teachers’ whole and small group lessons individualized for each class, as well as students’ practice sessions both at home and at school, could have also resulted in improved STAR reading scores.

Recommendations for Practitioners: There is no one-size-fits-all solution when implementing such technology to a diverse array of learners on different reading levels, such as Tier 1 (high reader), Tier 2 (medium average benchmark reader), and Tier 3 (low reader). It is essential to provide professional development and training opportunities for teachers. Teachers can also train and elevate the higher achieving students with using IStation to monitor their own progress as well as set their own individual learning goals.

Recommendation for Researchers: We recommend studies with a larger sample size that would likely yield more definitive and generalizable results, studies using a randomized control group that would have teased out extraneous factors and truly measuring the effects of IStation alone on STAR, as well as longitudinal studies examining the long-term effects of IStation.},

 abstract = {In the article, the defined problem has been justified and the significance of studying foreign experience in training future technology and engineering teachers in the USA has been determined. Particular attention has been paid to explanation of methods and forms of organization of future technology and engineering teachers’ training in the USA. The authors have considered Education Technology Standards, developed by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), that are used as reference points and determine the minimum amount of training as well as electives. In addition, there have been outlined such training techniques as microteaching, reflective teaching, the simulation method that allow involving the students into real teaching rather than role-playing; decrease complexity of pedagogical actions through ensuring acquisition of specific skills needed for the teacher in order to form experience of pedagogical interaction. It has been found out that in order to prove themselves during the first year of study in a higher education institution the students create their own web pages and portfolios that consist of working portfolio, showcase portfolio and documentation portfolio. It has been established that mini courses are actively used to help future technology and engineering teachers acquire necessary pedagogical skills. Based on analysis of the research findings, the authors have concluded that counseling or mentoring as forms of training greatly contribute to personal development of both students and their mentor as well as effective collaboration between school and university staff. It has been identified that enhancing effectiveness of teaching practice in American higher education institutions ensures involving clinical professors who monitor, guide and assess teaching practice of future specialists.},

 abstract = {The processes of modernisation evident at all levels, which reflected on everyday life and were the key factors of lifestyle changes and of social, cultural and pedagogical movements at the fin de siècle in Europe, reflected also upon Croatia, particularly its urban areas. European reformist pedagogy, with its key representatives and concepts, reached Croatian teachers as well, at least in the form of general awareness. The reformist pedagogy in Croatia was established by two teachers from Zagreb, Vjekoslav Koščević and Ivan Tomašić. Their reformist attempts were evident in their stands against Herbart’s pedagogy, in gathering experience of and insights in the reformist pedagogy movements in Central European countries and the implementation of those insights in their own pedagogical practice, as well as in their attempts of organised promotion of reformist ideas through the Croatian Society for the Improvement of Edification and the Preporod journal. Numerous teachers were waiting to see how the “century of the child” was going to develop, adjusting discretely their pedagogical practice to the new spirit. After the First World War, in the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kingdom of Yugoslavia after 1929), Croatian teachers were active in the area of practical school reform, or didactical-methodical renewal, which meant a continuation of the pre-World War I process. The working school, as the main goal of the didactical-methodical renewal, became an official pedagogical trend in the 1930s, under the strong influence of educational policy and ideology of Yugoslavia of the time. From the mid-1930s, the state model schools took over the task of working school training courses for teachers as a model of professional development of teachers for the new school. The main representatives of the working school movement in Croatia included Ante Defrančeski, Josip Demarin, Mate Demarin, Salih Ljubunčić, Marijan Markovac, Zlatko Špoljar and Stjepan Zaninović, among others. Academically educated pedagogues and theoretical scholars, who addressed the key issues of pedagogy as a spiritual-scientific or philosophical discipline, appeared in Croatia during the two decades between the two wars: Stjepan Matičević, Pavao Vuk-Pavlović, Stjepan Pataki, Vladimir Petz and others. At the same time, they were also staying in touch with the then current pedagogic reality and critiquing certain negative phenomena in the practice of the new school. The reformist pedagogy was also reflected in other areas of educational work, such as adult education, mass health education, social care and child care, children’s and youth organisations, collaboration between parents and schools and various forms of cultural and artistic activities with and for children. The alternative concepts of pedagogy opened the door towards pedagogy and school pluralism in Croatia in the 1990s, but two decades later, it is still in its initial phase of development.},

 abstract = {Online professional development (OPD) is gaining increasing popularity. However, online learning environments are not always considered effective venues for supporting authentic learning experiences, and the suitability of OPD for practical learning has not been widely explored. This case study paper presents findings of a pilot implementation of an OPD program in vaccine management designed according to the pedagogical principles of authentic learning, using a range of educational technologies as cognitive tools. The study examines how the authentic learning design and the technologies used affect the participants’ learning experience, experience of authenticity and the perceived impact of the course on professional learning. Data was collected through observations, an online post-course survey and interviews with the participants. A thematic content analysis was conducted. The findings suggest the pedagogical framework of authentic e-learning provides useful guidelines for the design of fully online, yet active and practice-driven, professional development that is also perceived as authentic by the participants. Using online education technologies as cognitive tools can support the creation of an authentic learning environment where practical, transferable professional skills can be acquired. Achieving this requires careful consideration of accessibility and usability issues and ensuring that the technologies used serve an authentic purpose.},

@article{pub.1099930760,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Student participation and the use of active methodologies in classroom learning are being increasingly emphasized. The use of intelligent systems can be of great help when designing and developing these types of activities. Recently, emerging disciplines such as 'educational data mining' and 'learning analytics and knowledge' have provided clear examples of the importance of the use of artificial intelligence techniques in education.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to gather expert opinions regarding the benefits of using complementary methods that are supported by intelligent systems, specifically, by intelligent information access systems, when processing texts written in natural language and the benefits of using these methods as companion tools to the learning activities that are employed by biomedical and health sciences teachers.
METHODS: Eleven teachers of degree courses who belonged to the Faculties of Biomedical Sciences (BS) and Health Sciences (HS) of a Spanish university in Madrid were individually interviewed. These interviews were conducted using a mixed methods questionnaire that included 66 predefined close-ended and open-ended questions. In our study, three intelligent information access systems (i.e., BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap) were successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions regarding the utility of these systems and their different methods in learning activities.
RESULTS: All teachers reported using active learning methods in the classroom, most of which were computer programs that were used for initially designing and later executing learning activities. All teachers used case-based learning methods in the classroom, with a specific emphasis on case reports written in Spanish and/or English. In general, few or none of the teachers were familiar with the technical terms related to the technologies used for these activities such as "intelligent systems" or "concept/mental maps". However, they clearly realized the potential applicability of such approaches in both the preparation and the effective use of these activities in the classroom. Specifically, the themes highlighted by a greater number of teachers after analyzing the responses to the open-ended questions were the usefulness of BioAnnote system to provide reliable sources of medical information and the usefulness of the bilingual nature of CLEiM system for learning medical terminology in English.
CONCLUSIONS: Three intelligent information access systems were successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions regarding the utility of these systems in learning activities. The results of this study showed that integration of reliable sources of information, bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the most valued features by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. In addition, in the context of our experimental conditions, our work provides useful insights into the way to appropriately integrate this type of intelligent information access systems into learning activities, revealing key themes to consider when developing such approaches.},

 abstract = {The pedagogical modelling of everyday classroom practice is an interesting kind of evidence, both for educational research and teachers' own professional development. This paper explores the usage of wearable sensors and machine learning techniques to automatically extract orchestration graphs (teaching activities and their social plane over time), on a dataset of 12 classroom sessions enacted by two different teachers in different classroom settings. The dataset included mobile eye-tracking as well as audiovisual and accelerometry data from sensors worn by the teacher. We evaluated both time-independent and time-aware models, achieving median F1 scores of about 0.7-0.8 on leave-one-session-out k-fold cross-validation. Although these results show the feasibility of this approach, they also highlight the need for larger datasets, recorded in a wider variety of classroom settings, to provide automated tagging of classroom practice that can be used in everyday practice across multiple teachers.},

 abstract = {With announcements such as «more than half the world own a cell phone» (Lefkowitz, 2010) plus the convergence of multi-media elements in handsets, it is perhaps not surprising that education is calling for an increased use of mobile phones to support learning (Hartnell-Young & Heym, 2008). Phone use will contribute to cost efficiencies by subsidising IT budgets (Yorston, 2010) and support personalised learning and students’ underpinning knowledge. However, the reality is often ‹blanket bans› on mobiles in schools (Hartnell-Young & Heym, 2008) due to teaching staff who are nervous of possible disruption and uncertain of pedagogic application. MENTOR ME (Mobile Enhanced Mentoring) was a pilot project with 20 teacher training students at Barnet College, North London. The limited time available to mentors and trainee teachers to engage in mentoring was solved by providing all students and mentors with email-activated mobile phones for ease of communication and support, facilitating situated learning (Naismith et al., 2004). Face-to-face meetings were partially replaced by capturing students’ formal and informal learning with mobile functionality. This was shared with peers, tutors, mentors and lesson observers to further improve the mentoring and teaching experience. Self-reflection, peer assessment, peer support and idea-sharing contributed to improving trainees’ practice and employability. In addition, teachers’ confidence and ability in using technology improved, particularly in supporting learning and underpinning knowledge. The success of this project has influenced the organisation to adopt mobile learning across the curriculum by facilitating student use of personal devices.},

If we take a look to the teachers serving in secondary school, we are faced with many educational backgrounds and different paths that lead professionals to teaching qualification. This paper describes the experience of three courses of Special Education at the University of Turin (Italy) carried out between 2014 and 2016. Two of these courses were held as part of “Percorsi Abilitanti Speciali (PAS)” and one in “Tirocini Formativi Attivi (TFA)”. In Special Education course for curricular teachers in PAS and TFA, an important purpose is constantly recalled by the educational path itself: the using of flexible learning strategies and personalized tools has shown to be an effective method encourage the testing of this type of teaching in future teachers.“Prima di tutto vediamo un po’ chi siete voi”: un’esperienza di modulazione didattica nei Tirocini Formativi Attivi e Percorsi Abilitanti SpecialiLa formazione degli insegnanti, nel tempo, ha assunto varie forme e finalità.

Il presente lavoro descrive l’esperienza di tre corsi di Pedagogia Speciale tenuti presso l’Università di Torino tra il 2014 e il 2016. Due di questi corsi sono stati tenuti nell’ambito di Percorsi Abilitanti Speciali ed uno in quello dei Tirocini Formativi Attivi. Nei corsi di pedagogia speciale per insegnanti curricolari descritti nel presente lavoro la finalità formativa primaria sembra essere richiamata costantemente dal percorso stesso: prevedere dei percorsi didattici flessibili e degli strumenti adatti ad ognuno. Tale modalità di lavoro è risultata gradita ai discenti che si sono posti il proposito di sperimentare questo tipo di didattica quando saranno insegnanti.},

 abstract = {L’uso sistematico che viene fatto del Quadro Comune Europeo di Riferimento per le lingue ai fini della valutazione e certificazione delle competenze linguistico-comunicative ha spesso messo in ombra le sue potenzialità come fondamentale strumento di formazione per gli insegnanti. Grazie al suo approccio analitico e descrittivo, il Quadro consente di esaminare in modo sistematico e approfondito sia i contenuti che i processi dell’apprendimento linguistico e, al contempo, di riesaminare criticamente le proprie concezioni della lingua e dell’apprendimento e le proprie prassi didattiche. I materiali di formazione che offre questo contributo, destinati a docenti di lingue e ai loro formatori, sono centrate principalmente sulla visione teorico-metodologica generale del Quadro (Capitoli 4 e 5). I materiali sono da intendersi come strumenti di facilitazione ed elaborazione personale della struttura concettuale del Quadro , e allo stesso tempo come un invito a riflettere sul documento originale in modo più approfondito. (Re)viewing the theoretical-methodological approach of the Common European Framework: training materials for teachers Since its publication, the Common European Framework has been used extensively for assessment and certification purposes. This has led users to underestimate its value as a potentially productive tool for teacher training. Thanks to its approach, which is both analytic and descriptive, the Framework offers teachers a unique opportunity to re-examine both the contents and the processes of language learning, and at the same time to adopt a critical view of their own conceptions of language and learning, as well as of their own teaching practices. The training materials included in this paper offer teachers and teacher-trainers a detailed re-examination of the theoretical and methodological bases of the Framework (Chapters 4 and 5). They are meant to help teachers reassess their own understanding of the conceptual structure of the Framework and invite them to reflect on the original document in a systematic way.},

 abstract = {Abstract: it is a historical exercise that selects the documentary and bibliographical studies to think the formation of teachers for the initial years of schooling from the practice of teaching/internship. It is organized in three historical moments. The first occurs in the nineteenth century when normal schools arise, and these were annexed to the so-called model schools, a space where the practical training of primary teachers would be given. Already, the second, is delimited by the years 1930 and 1940, period in which Pedagogy becomes a course of higher education and the colleges of application arise as a space for practical training of degrees. The third is at the end in the 1960s, through Resolution No. 9/69, which established that teaching practice should be conducted as a supervised internship in the community schools themselves. Once this historical itinerary has been fulfilled, the text highlights some of the concerns derived from the act of thinking and performing the internship in schools and the engenderings involved.

Pegadas históricas da prática de ensino e questões atuais do estágio na formação de professores

Resumo: trata-se de um exercício histórico que elege os estudos documental e bibliográfico para pensar a formação de professores para os anos iniciais da escolarização a partir da prática de ensino/estágio. Organiza-se em três momentos históricos. O primeiro se dá no século XIX quando surgem as escolas normais, sendo que a estas eram anexadas às denominadas escolas modelo, espaço onde se daria a formação prática de professores primários. Já, o segundo, é delimitado pelos anos 1930 e 1940, período em que a Pedagogia se torna curso do ensino superior e os colégios de aplicação surgem como espaço de formação prática das licenciaturas. O terceiro se dá no final nos anos 1960, por meio da Resolução Nº 9/69, que estabelecia que a prática de ensino deveria ser realizada na forma de estágio supervisionado nas próprias escolas da comunidade. Cumprido o referido itinerário histórico, o texto destaca algumas inquietações derivadas do ato de pensar e realizar o estágio nas escolas e os engendramentos aí implicados.},

 abstract = {The change of teachers’ professional development paradigm, especially professional training, is an important precondition while implementing positive changes in school practice. Reflective practice is considered as an efficient way of professional development. Classroom management and discipline, as a segment of educational work, traditionally is perceived as the greatest challenge while simultaneously neglected in professional training. The aim of this research was to identify if there is a difference in teachers’ self-evaluation of behavior and job satisfaction in classroom management and discipline regarding the form of their professional training. The research sample size was 218 Croatian teachers into experimental and control group. Results showed significant differences between groups. Reflective practice implementation (experimental group) results in more positive teachers’ self-evaluation of behavior and job satisfaction in classroom management and discipline than education (control group). The results indicate that proposed reflective practice model can be good foundation for efficient reorganization of professional training and change of professional development paradigm.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT In Italy, since the late 1990s there have been many research works on school and educational publishing, interlacing with the current fields of investigation common in Europe and beyond. Numerous earlier studies offered historians deeper knowledge of school publishing, in terms of the production and distribution of school textbooks between the 19th and 20th centuries, school publishers, legislation on school textbooks and the ideologies and values underlying school text. However, very few studies have investigated the aspects specifically linked to the history of the subject teaching methods in these books, and their everyday practical use and application by the teachers in the class. This essay analyses a teacher training manual to identify the words and expressions that offer clues and signs of the underlying methodological and teaching traditions, revealing the pedagogic and educational knowledge used for teacher education. The work analyses a teacher training manual, like a young Sherlock Holmes searching with a magnifying glass for clues among single words or sentences that can reveal the archeologically stratified teaching traditions of the early 19th century. Keywords: Primary school. Textbooks. Teacher training. Material school culture. Resumo: Pesquisas sobre a história da editoria pedagógica e acadêmica conheceram um fecundo período de estudos, a partir do final dos anos de 1990, na Itália, entrelaçando-se com uma linha comum de investigação generalizada em nível europeu e internacional. Os numerosos estudos já realizados nos permitiram alcançar um conhecimento mais profundo da editoria educacional, ao nível de produção editorial e da circulação de manuais escolares entre o Oitocentos e Novecentos, sobre os editores para a escola, sobre disposições normativas relacionadas ao livro escolar e sobre aspectos ideológicos e valorativos subjacentes aos livros-texto. Todavía poco estudiados son los aspectos más relacionados a la historia de las metodologías y de la enseñanza disciplinar presentes en los libros destinados al aula y el uso real, la práctica concreta del libro en el aula en la mediación desarrollada por los docentes. En este artículo se ofrece un análisis de un libro escolar al recoger palabras y frases reveladoras de "indicios" y "acechados" de tradiciones metodológicas y didácticas subyacentes, capaces de revelar la circulación del saber pedagógico y didáctico destinado a la formación de los docentes.

Le numerose ricerche già svolte hanno permesso di giungere ad una conoscenza più approfondita dell’editoria scolastica, a livello di produzione editoriale e di circolazione dei manuali scolastici tra Ottocento e Novecento, sugli editori per la scuola, sulle disposizioni normative legate al libro scolastico e sugli aspetti ideologici e valoriali sottesi ai libri di testo. Ancora poco studiati appaiono gli aspetti più squisitamente legati alla storia delle metodologie e delle didattiche disciplinari presenti nei libri nonché l’uso reale, la pratica concreta del libro in classe nella mediazione didattica svolta dai docenti. In questo contributo si offre l’analisi di un manuale scolastico per coglierne parole e frasi rivelatrici di ‘indizi’ e spie’ di tradizioni metodologiche e didattiche sottese, capaci di rivelare la circolazione del sapere pedagogico e didattico destinato alla formazione dei docenti. Si analizzerà in particolare un manuale per maestri come novelli Sherlock Holmes, alla ricerca di tracce con la lente del detective sulle singole parole o frasi rivelatrici tradizioni didattiche archeologicamente stratificate nella prima metà dell’Ottocento. Parole chiave: Scuola Elementare; Libri di Testo; Formazione dei Maestri; Cultura materiale della scuola.  },

 abstract = {In the frame of the University classroom on Multimedia research methods, providing Continuing Professional Development opportunities for teachers, trainees were asked to record one lesson that they would typically perform and analyze it against a specific protocol, named Evident, which encompasses several steps and tools. The theoretical frameworks this action-research activity draws on are the School Effectiveness Approach by Creemers and Kyriakides, the Visible Learning work by Hattie and the Lesson Study practice, mainly used in Asian countries. After analyzing their video against a dedicated self-assessment Grid, thanks to the Radar Builder tool teachers visualized their positioning in a diagram helping them to understand which areas were to be improved in order to make their teaching more effective. A further step was to peer review the work of one colleague, but just for those who volunteered to do so.   Videoripresa in classe: uno specchio per il professionista riflessivo Nell’ambito del corso Metodi di ricerca in ambiente multimediale, indirizzato a docenti in servizio, è stato chiesto ai corsisti di videoregistrare una tipica lezione e analizzarla sulla base di uno specifico protocollo, denominato Evident, che comprende diversi strumenti. I framework teorici che hanno ispirato questo lavoro di ricerca-azione sono il lavoro di Creemers and Kyriakides relativo al filone dello School Improvement, quello di Hattie sul Visible Learning e la pratica del Lesson Study, particolarmente diffusa nel mondo orientale. Dopo aver analizzato il video con la specifica scheda di autoanalisi, il docente attraverso lo strumento del Radar Builder aveva una rappresentazione visiva (Radar) dei propri punti di debolezza e di forza in base ai fattori di efficacia di una lezione.

 abstract = {Due to the establishment of the educational and institutional system in students from birth to six years old, teachers are required to reflect on how to design a scholastic skills-based curriculum. Additionally, they are also required to understand how to ensure the continuity in teaching, especially in the first classes of primary school. In order to qualify these processes, the courses for professional teaching development are built with the aim to share the best teaching and assessment practices. This paper shows the outcomes of a Professional Development-Research (PD-R) that has expected the development and the insertion of a “Reality Task” in form of simulation. In the Professional Development-Research (PD-R) the focus has been on the development of some transversal competencies that imply the abilities to solve problems, make decisions, be autonomous, collaborate with others and re-elaborate experiences.   Promuovere e accertare competenze nelle classi prime di scuola primaria: il dispositivo “compito di realtà” in forma di simulazione Con l’istituzione del “Sistema integrato di educazione e di istruzione dalla nascita sino ai sei anni” i docenti sono chiamati a riflettere su come progettare un curricolo scolastico orientato alle competenze e come garantire la continuità didattica nelle classi iniziali del primo ciclo. Per qualificare questi processi i percorsi di formazione e sviluppo professionale dei docenti svolgono una funzione strategica valorizzando la condivisione di buone pratiche didattiche e valutative. Il contributo approfondisce gli esiti di una Ricerca-Formazione (R-F) che ha previsto l’elaborazione e l’introduzione del “compito di realtà” in forma di simulazione. Nel progetto di R-F l’interesse è stato focalizzato sullo sviluppo di alcune competenze trasversali che implicano la capacità di risolvere situazioni problematiche, assumendo decisioni, esercitando la propria autonomia, collaborando con altri e rielaborando l’esperienza.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the awareness of pre-service science teachers about secondary education in future intelligence information society. The research tool was composed of three areas such as the change of educational system, the role of teacher and the teacher’s competency required for teaching in the future intelligence information society. Thirty four re-service science teachers were requested to write freely their thoughts about them. Their answers were categorized to the detailed areas. Preservice science teachers predicted that ubiquitous education will become more common as the teaching and learning methods of artificial intelligence and robotic engineering would be improved, and the role of teachers and also the number of teachers are greatly reduced in the future intelligence information society. In addition, subject instruction will be mainly carried out by robots or artificial intelligence, and teachers will be expected to play a role of co-teaching with humanity instruction and artificial intelligence. In the future intelligence information society, students would be required the competencies such as information literacy, communication ability, technology and media literacy. It is necessary to develop a pre-service teacher education program to educate students for preparing future intelligence information society, and to raise educational philosophy and goals, curriculum, education contents, education method, and educational purpose of teacher training course.},

 abstract = {Background: To sustain the standards of quality medical education, the faculty needs to be well trained in the medical education technologies, both traditional and innovative. Students are the real beneficiaries of all training programmes conducted for faculty development and they appreciate good teaching. Their involvement in all possible aspects of teaching and learning will go a long way in achieving the best outcomes. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of an ‘Abridged course in Medical Education Technology’ for entry level teachers based on the students’ evaluation of the (teaching) performance of the teachers. Methods: An interventional study was carried out amongst 447 students, in which an educational intervention was done and the effectiveness of the ‘Abridged course’ was assessed. Teaching by the teacher trained through the ‘Abridged course’ formed the ‘intervention’ in the study. ‘Evaluation of the teaching performance’ by the students was the outcome studied. Results: The performance of teacher as assessed by the students had a higher mean score (61.28, SD 9.8) for residents who underwent training in medical education technology, as compared to other residents (56.81, SD 9.2) with a p-value of <0.001. Conclusions: This study highlights that an abridged course in teaching methodology for entry level medical teachers improves the quality of their teaching.},

 abstract = {The curricular framework for a licentiate degree course has a direct influence on the type of teacher it will be qualifying.  Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze the curricular framework for the Chemistry Licentiate Degree Course through DE by the IFMT Cuiabá-Bela Vista Campus in order to verify conformities with the national official documents and to indicate any adjustments for conformance. It is a document analysis from a qualitative approach that took place during 2016 and 2017. It was verified that the current matrix, as proposed in 2012, complies with the total hours required for the supervised internship, for complementary activities, and for practice as a curricular component, however, it does not comply with the 3,200 hours required for a licentiate degree course. It was found that the above matrix includes important and compulsory themes, such as the Brazilian Sign Language, inclusive education, youngster and adult education, and environmental education; but it does not include ethnic-racial issues, for example. One other aspect that was verified is the lack of discussions on the history, epistemology and/or philosophy of science, STS education, and education technologies. Therefore, the curricular framework analyzed complies in part with the national curriculum guidelines but needs some adjustments regarding the total course hours that could be achieved through the insertion of subjects of both specific and pedagogical types.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The primary goal of the project was to conduct a narrative review of the published literature to identify and summarize best practices for developing oncology-focused research and training experiences for AI/AN undergraduate, graduate and professional students. A secondary goal was to identify methodological limitations and areas for future research related to rigorous educational program evaluation. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION:. Published literature was searched using databases relevant to oncology (PubMed, Web of Science) and sociology (PsychINFO, SocIndex). The bibliographies of identified relevant papers were searched for additional references by title. Search terms included synonyms and commonly used terms for three general areas: (1) target population (e.g., American Indian), (2) training area (e.g., oncology), and (3) educational program (e.g., undergraduate). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS:. A current total of 107 original publications and 33 review papers that are relevant to the project goals have been identified. Key areas of program development and implementation relate to advertising and recruitment; didactic curriculum in research methods, cancer health disparities, and professional development and career planning; research immersion experiences through shadowing, networking, application of research skills, and opportunities to develop oral and written communication skills; ongoing career development support; mentoring by faculty, advanced trainees, and peers; and culture-specific enrichment. Important areas for program evaluation relate to measures of reaction, knowledge, practice and long-term outcomes. Evaluation design approaches include observational and experimental designs with recommendations for identifying relevant control groups. Strategies to ensure complete long-term follow-up are also summarized. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT:.Successful programs address barriers related to perceived lack of abilities, lack of AI role models, limited culture-specific enrichment, and limited mentoring and ongoing career development support. Program directors should work with local tribal and community leaders when creating a new program. A high degree of coordination is needed to create a bicultural program to interest students in a research career and avoid the creation of barriers hidden to the program director. There are opportunities to improve the rigor of educational program evaluation in this setting by including measures beyond self-reported reaction and knowledge to focus on educational program enrollment and completion and long-term career outcomes. Methodologic challenges include identification of relevant control groups for comparison and the use of experimental designs.},

Preliminary psychometric information from 142 observations across 52 teachers (average of 2 videos per teacher) provided internal consistency and validity information. Our analyses resulted in a significant and highly reliable 5-factor solution comprising 33 items. These five factors are: Challenging Status Quo Knowledge, Equitable Learning Opportunities for RMLs, Equitable Discipline, Connections to Home Life, and Personalized Learning Opportunities. Concurrent and divergent validity between ACSES and the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) indicated these factors are associated with distinct aspects of classroom interactions. Lastly, correlations between teacher socio-demographic (age and race/ethnicity) and professional (years teaching, education, and major) characteristics and ACSES factor scores were considered.

 abstract = {The aim of this research was to explore research trends and issues in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in South Korea. To accomplish this, we conducted an analysis of 222 peer-reviewed journal papers related to ESD in South Korea. The research concentrated on identifying four characteristics of ESD research: 1) key publication features, 2) the research topics described, 3) the research design employed, and 4) the types of sample/subjects. The results showed that the initial ESD research began in South Korea in 2005, and the number of the journal papers has increased since 2010. Regarding research topics, more research has been conducted on establishing conceptual or theoretical foundations related to ESD. Moreover, teachers’ attitudes or perceptions and program development associated with sustainable development were studied in depth. There were similar ratios of the theoretical research, quantitative research, and qualitative research regarding research design but mixed methods studies indicating the least ratio. Content analysis was the most prevalent analysis technique for quantitative/mixed ESD research. Regarding data sources or participants, the most common data source was the literature. Several research suggestions were made for assessing ESD programs and in-service teachers’ ESD professional development.

 abstract = {The paper explores the challenges of designing personalised learning paths in SPOCs (Small Private Online Courses). It opens with a discussion on different approaches to tailoring teaching to individual needs and moves on to introduce a SPOC that was developed for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for primary and lower-secondary teachers in Denmark. The SPOC, which performs adaptation using a recommendation system, allows for students to create a personalised learning path on the basis of three components: a learner profile, a content model and an adaptation model. Using the three components as a starting point, the SPOC is analysed in order to identify differences between the intended design (what the SPOC set out to do), the implemented design (how the SPOC is used by its users) and the attained design (the outcome of the SPOC). The analysis draws on data from a series of semi-structured interviews with SPOC students and their lecturers. We find that the implemented design deviates from the intended design in several respects, most notably in relation to how the personalised learning paths are created and how decisions as to curriculum contents are made. Moreover, it is suggested that differences between the intended design and the implemented design are rooted in differences in the learning perspectives of the students, the lecturers and the educational designers of the SPOC. Despite the fact that the implemented design deviates from the intended design, the attained design is nevertheless successful in that a high percentage of the students enrolled succeeded in passing their examinations and thus obtained the formal qualifications in the subjects they teach. It is concluded that further research in adaptive learning designs for online platforms such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) and SPOCs is needed to minimise the gap between intended designs and implemented designs in order to create a more personalised learning experience for the students involved.},

 abstract = {Aim/Purpose: In the modern world, simulation has become a new phenomenon in education, which conveys new and innovative ideas of curriculum, instruction, and classroom management. It makes certain of Aristotle’s words when he said that “The things we have to learn before we do them, we must learn by doing them”. One might think that simulation in education is one of these technologies. 
This study examined preservice and new teachers’ perceptions about the con-cept of conflict and educational conflict management in a simulation workshop conducted at the Academic Arab College’s Simulation Center in Haifa, Israel.

Background: Simulation engages learners in “deep learning” and empowers their understanding. In other words, simulation provides an alternative real world experience.
As part of our work at the Educational Simulation Center in the Arab Academic College in Haifa, Israel, we examined the performance and contribution of educators who visit the center and participate in educational conflict management simulation workshops.

Methodology: A mixed methods study was conducted. A total of 237 participants of preservice teachers from diverse professions were divided into 15 groups to examine the research question: How does the experience of participating in a simulation workshop affect preservice teachers’ perception about the concept of conflict?

Contribution: This study seeks to contribute to simulation and conflict management in education. This contribution to the body of literature can help researchers, scholars, students, and education technology professionals to advance simulation research studies.  

Findings: The study findings indicate that there is a high degree of satisfaction (more than 90%) among preservice teachers in participating in the workshop. It also indicates a positive and significant change in participants’ perceptions of the concept of conflict and the management of conflict situations.

Recommendations for Practitioners: In light of the study findings, it is recommended that new teachers be exposed to simulation workshops with a variety of scenarios dealing with different conflict situations. This exposure could contribute to their professional development and conduct in a more efficient and convenient manner in schools.},

Sullo sfondo altre questioni, indizi di una debole sintonizzazione tra ricerca didattica, formazione dei docenti e modalità di accertamento finale delle competenze degli allievi, ad esempio: grado di diffusione e radicamento nelle conoscenze dei docenti di nuclei teorici di linguistica educativa contenuti negli obiettivi curricolari dai Programmi Brocca alle Indicazioni Nazionali ; adeguatezza dei tipi di protocolli di esame di stato rispetto ai traguardi di competenze di scrittura indicati nei documenti programmatici; consapevolezza critica, nelle scelte metodologiche dei docenti, dell’intreccio degli uni e degli altri.   Theoretical frameworks, teaching practices and types of writing test protocols   The typology of writing protocols is the thematic thread that runs through the issues discussed in the article: the relationship between writing from sources and the types of exams developed on the occasion of the 1999 reform, changes in approach present in the revision of the first test of 2018, comparison between different ways of writing documented in some exam protocols from a few European schools. There are other underlying questions, indications of weak links between didactic research, teacher training and methods for the final assessment of students’ competences, for example: the degree of diffusion and rooting of theoretical nuclei of educational linguistics contained in the curriculum objectives, from the Programmi Brocca to the Indicazioni Nazionali , in teachers’ knowledge;  the adequacy of the types of state examination protocols with respect to the goals of writing skills indicated in the program documents; critical awareness of their interweaving in teachers' methodological choices.},

 abstract = {<b>Background and Objectives:</b> Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is one of the most challenging diagnoses in primary care, and misdiagnosis is costly. The aim of this educational needs assessment was to assess primary care physicians' (PCPs) knowledge of AI diagnosis and management as a preliminary step in developing a professional education module to address knowledge of practice gaps. <b>Methods:</b> We developed a 12-item needs assessment and pretested questionnaire items prior to use to gather validity evidence. The questionnaire contained 4 AI knowledge items, 4 needs assessment items, and 4 demographic items. It was administered to 100 PCPs across a single integrated health care system over a 6-month period. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-one of 100 questionnaires were returned. The majority of respondents believed their knowledge of AI diagnosis and management was "average" when compared with peers. Responses indicated that PCPs were fairly comfortable diagnosing, but not managing AI patients. There was no association between respondents' clinical knowledge of AI and respondents' roles as clinical instructors (ie, having trainees assigned to them). A total of 54% of respondents said they utilized online resources to enhance current knowledge of AI and 88% of respondents said they would use a new AI resource, if available. When asked to rank preferences for professional development modalities, 26/38 respondents ranked UpToDate, 21/38 respondents ranked traditional lecture, and 19/38 respondents ranked case discussion among their top 3 choices. <b>Conclusion:</b> Results of this needs assessment showed that PCPs within our health care system both needed and desired professional development targeting AI diagnosis and management. A faculty development session, which included a short lecture and case scenarios, was developed and delivered to PCPs at participating family health centers. Session materials are now available for use by other institutions to meet professional development needs on this important topic.},

The school, as a social space marked by diversity, is no longer able to stop the technology brought by students and their easy accessibility. So, it’s important to think about  the educational process in order to integrate mathematics education technology. Methodologically it carried out a document analysis, through which it sought to meet these challenges. This article analyzes some important aspects of the challenge of math teachers programs besides all the technological innovations. So, it is important to know the technological, educational and professional components, showing the dialectical relationships established by these matters and how they apply in the training of teaching profile that we are forming. It is concluded that with the use of technology teacher becomes familiar with it, and that your domain can cause him to take a fresh look about it, we investigate the use of technology can help in producing changes in teaching practice.

It can be seen how the official documents of education bolster the recommendations made by the NMC Horizon Report - 2016 Higher Education Edition. However, if the conversation between the documents and the report is a reality to be celebrated, the spinning reveals a crucial problem to education, poor training of teachers on the need for integration of technology. The need for teaching qualification is a reality that was also intensified by the advent of technology and degrees as those that foresee the formation of physics teachers, for example, must guide such training in accordance with the recommendations that categorically intertwine documents and reports that support the education.Keywords: NMC Horizon Report: Higher Education Edition 2016.

 abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the opportunities and challenges that arise with the proliferation of new technology, to provide an understanding of why it is important to try new strategies in education, and to provide an inclusive framework for experimentation using tools such as robotisation, automatisation, artificial intelligence and immersive learning. Significant challenges exist in implementing transformative technologies with a limited or non-existent evidence base for their use, and designing inclusive educational experiences with a limited evidence base is even more challenging. In order to address this need, the article presents some ways in which educators can make informed implementation decisions around these new tools. First, we examine the rule of the least dangerous assumption, which supports trying new technologies even if the evidence base is lacking. Next, we present a strategy that educators can use to apply the research-based framework of UDL in order to make informed implementation choices with new technologies. Finally, based on information gained from experience in providing professional development, school level implementation, individual student interventions and teacher focus groups, we offer some recommendations for practice. We present several fun propositions that can help create a culture to support educators as they endeavour to create inclusive educational experiences with emerging technologies. We also explore current trends in technology use, describing and providing practical examples of implementation and integration to support a more inclusive future with emerging technologies.},

River Styles Framework provides a coherent, carefully structured (scaffolded) approach that synthesises geomorphic understandings of rivers as a baseline to support river management applications. As the approach is generic, principles and procedures can applied in any setting. The Framework and its applications build on fundamental research into river forms and processes. Importantly, the Framework was developed in collaboration with river management agencies in New South Wales, Australia and has been used in collaboration with practitioners elsewhere in the world. This paper documents the process used to teach the five-day River Styles professional short course in Brazil, September 2017. We report upon some pedagogical foundations of the Framework to explain the approach to teaching. We present an overview of the types of exercises taught in Brazil, showing how local fieldwork and case studies support the uptake of this geomorphic information to inform river management. We emphasise the importance of careful planning in delivering a coherent product that integrates remotely-sensed work, field interpretation skills and lecture/practical class exercises. These exercises build upon foundation research in fluvial geomorphology in the Macaé Catchment in Rio de Janeiro State.},

Currently, the most effective mechanism is for an expert to observe one or more lectures and provide personalized formative feedback to the instructor. Of course, this is expensive and unscalable, and perhaps most critically, precludes a continuous learning feedback loop for the instructor. In this paper, we present the culmination of two years of research and development on EduSense, a comprehensive sensing system that produces a plethora of theoretically-motivated visual and audio features correlated with effective instruction, which could feed professional development tools in much the same way as a Fitbit sensor reports step count to an end user app. Although previous systems have demonstrated some of our features in isolation, EduSense is the first to unify them into a cohesive, real-time, in-the-wild evaluated, and practically-deployable system. Our two studies quantify where contemporary machine learning techniques are robust, and where they fall short, illuminating where future work remains to bring the vision of automated classroom analytics to reality.},

The method applied in this study was a Mixed method, using data from alumni who graduated in 2016-2017 through questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The results showed that the variables in TPACK, content knowledge variable and pedagogy content knowledge variable had a high average compared to other variables, namely 73.50 and 73.10. This indicated that from the pedagogic and content side, Education Technology alumni had a good mastery of content and pedagogical knowledge. However, being viewed from the average score in applying technology, their competence was still low. The Technology Pedagogy Knowledge variable achieved 48.30, while the TPACK variable reached 52.40. These results implies that Education Technology alumni still need to improve their TPACK competence in order to become a professional teacher in the era of industrial revolution 4.0.},

 abstract = {Teachers must be able to monitor students’ behavior and identify valid cues in order to draw conclusions about students’ actual engagement in learning activities. Teacher training can support (inexperienced) teachers in developing these skills by using videotaped teaching to highlight which indicators should be considered. However, this supposes that (a) valid indicators of students’ engagement in learning are known and (b) work with videos is designed as effectively as possible to reduce the effort involved in manual coding procedures and in examining videos. One avenue for addressing these issues is to utilize the technological advances made in recent years in fields such as machine learning to improve the analysis of classroom videos. Assessing students’ attention-related processes through visible indicators of (dis)engagement in learning might become more effective if automated analyses can be employed. Thus, in the present study, we validated a new manual rating approach and provided a proof of concept for a machine vision-based approach evaluated on pilot classroom recordings of three lessons with university students. The manual rating system was significantly correlated with self-reported cognitive engagement, involvement, and situational interest and predicted performance on a subsequent knowledge test. The machine vision-based approach, which was based on gaze, head pose, and facial expressions, provided good estimations of the manual ratings. Adding a synchrony feature to the automated analysis improved correlations with the manual ratings as well as the prediction of posttest variables. The discussion focuses on challenges and important next steps in bringing the automated analysis of engagement to the classroom.},

 abstract = {The article describes the main components of the teacher’s professional training for the implementation of the idea of the New Ukrainian School, the role of integrating the theoretical and practical training of future teachers, and the peculiarities of the introduction of dual education into pedagogical activity. The innovative methods, technologies and forms of educational activity organization during the study of theoretical foundations of pedagogy, the peculiarities of their application in practical and seminary classes, have been separated, in particular, individualized and differentiated learning, group forms of activity, mixed and adaptive learning, a digital storytelling, a personalized learning, an inverted class, a virtual classroom, a gaming education, STEM education, a training, debate, etc. The main aspects that promote the professional competencies of students, their technological and personal readiness, and the formation of a competitive specialist in this field during the pedagogical practice are investigated.
The correlation between theory and practice in pedagogical activity has certain regularities. The objective laws of pedagogical activity determine only its main direction. The forms of manifestation of pedagogical patterns are multivariate; in different situations they can be different and determined by specific conditions. The theory of pedagogy gives only a possible choice of methods, techniques, means and forms of content implementation, but can not predict many specific situations, give timely guidance for each case.
The integration of theoretical and practical future teachers’ training contributes to activating cognitive activity of students, forming a holistic view of the future profession, creating the optimal conditions for gaining strong knowledge and skills in the work. A student integrates into the school system, improves the theoretical and methodological knowledge, practical skills and examines the age and psychological characteristics of children.
The New Ukrainian School is designed to form a person capable of being successful in life, holistic and versatile, initiative, patriot with an active position, an innovator capable of changing the world. To accomplish the above tasks, a professional teacher must possess a range of competencies such as informational, digital, research, civic, linguistic-communicative, social, technological, etc. An educational activity at the institution of higher education is constructed in such a way as to ensure the formation and improvement of the professional competences necessary for the New Ukrainian School teacher. The specificity of the professional training of future teachers is to ensure continuity and integration of the theoretical and practical components of training.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). One of the common CVDs is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Recent studies conducted in heart cells of mice have shown that this condition involves a chemical modification called hydroxymethylation of the DNA of heart cells.
OBJECTIVE: Objectives of the proposed research are to profile the distribution of 5-hydroxymethylation in the cardiomyocyte (CMC) genome of cadaveric cardiac tissue and cardiac biopsy specimens; to compare the hydroxymethylome of cadaveric CMCs with that of cardiac biopsy specimens from HCM patients and/or cardiac transplant patients (control) undergoing cardiac catheterization; to histologically appraise sarcomere distribution and mitochondrial morphology of CMCs in the presence of HCM; to correlate the mitochondrial genome with the HCM phenotype; and to integrate anatomy with biochemistry and genetics into the instructional design of HCM in the core medical curriculum at Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU).
METHODS: Normal and hypertrophic heart specimens will be obtained from 8 whole-body cadavers (2/8, 25% control and 6/8, 75% HCM). Myocardial biopsy specimens will be obtained from cardiothoracic and transplant units at the Cleveland Clinic in Abu Dhabi, UAE. As this is a proof-of-concept study, we plan to recruit 5 patients with HCM, where HCM has been diagnosed according to the guidelines of the 2014 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines. Patients with valvular heart disease, history of myocarditis, regular alcohol consumption, or cardiotoxic chemotherapy will be excluded. The control biopsy specimens will be obtained from patients who had received heart transplants. Three investigational approaches will then be employed: (1) gross anatomical evaluation, (2) histological analysis, and (3) profiling and analysis of the hydroxymethylome. These investigations will be pursued with minor modifications, if required, to the standard protocols and in accordance with institutional policy. The objective associated with the education of health professionals will be addressed through a strategy based on Graham's knowledge translation model.
RESULTS: This study is at the protocol-development stage. The validated questionnaires have been identified in relation to the objectives. The MBRU and the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Institutional Review Board (IRB) are reviewing this study. Further clarification and information can be obtained from the MBRU IRB. There is funding in place for this study (MBRU-CM-RG2019-08). Currently, we are in the process of standardizing the protocols with respect to the various molecular techniques to be employed during the course of the study. The total duration of the proposed research is 24 months, with a provision for 6 months of a no-cost extension.
CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of CVDs has recently received significant focus from the public health sector in the UAE. HCM is a common familial heart disease, contributing to the sudden increase in the mortality rate of young Emiratis in the UAE. Incorporating artificial intelligence into the identification of epigenetic risk factors associated with HCM will promote accurate diagnosis and lead to the development of improved management plans, hence, positive patient outcomes. Furthermore, integration of these findings into the instructional design of undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuous professional development medical curricula will further contribute to the body of knowledge regarding HCM.

 abstract = {<b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b>The Committee was charged with the responsibility for examining the need for change in pharmacy education and the models of leadership that would enable that change to occur across the academy. They also examined the question of faculty wellbeing in a time of change and made several recommendations and suggestions regarding both charges. Building upon the work of the previous Academic Affairs Committee, the 2018-19 AAC encourages the academy to implement new curricular models supporting personalized learning that creates engaged and lifelong learners. This will require transformational leadership and substantial investments in faculty development and new assessment strategies and resources. Recognizing that the magnitude of the recommended change will produce new stress on faculty, the committee identified the need for much additional work on student, faculty and leaders' wellbeing, noting the limited amount of empirical evidence on pharmacy related to stress and resilience. That said, if faculty and administrators are not able to address personal and community wellbeing, their ability to support their students' wellbeing will be compromised.},

 abstract = {This qualitative study on the Finnish basic education curriculum (2016) had two goals. First, to survey the origins of first two new curriculum competences: 1) thinking and learning to learn, and, 2) cultural competences. Second, to analyse the local curricular implementation and comprehension in a rapid socio-cultural change. To reveal the possible data trends, two research questions were addressed: 1. What was the background of first two 2016 transversal core competencies? 2. How were those competencies implemented into a local curriculum 2016-19? The Data included basic education curricula (1985-2016), and a local curriculum. Relevant legislation, official information (e.g. PISA), parental feedback, and a questionnaire to an anonymous implementing principal comprised the curricular data. The Data triangulation was completed with a wide range of educational, cultural and ideological research. Regarding ethics, the individual sources and educational provider remained anonymous. Findings were surprising. “Modern” thinking and learning skills were created in early 20th century American society by Deweyan comprehension. However, an immigration had changed the long-lasting interpretation on the origins of Finnish culture. Moreover, local curriculum implementation was more successfully comprehended and supported. Conclusions were obvious: more identifiable research and teachers’ training were needed for curricular reforms and competences. The socio-cultural comprehension in the era of AI asked for sound arguments.},

 abstract = {Digital technologies are currently one of the most used resources among students for developing their personalized learning environment. However, recent studies continue to demonstrate a lack of usage on the part of teaching staff for developing their teaching practices, especially at the university level. Through the identification of personal, professional, institutional, and contextual barriers, this study seeks to reveal the reasons why teachers in institutions of higher education do not use digital technologies for teaching purposes and whether the academic discipline influences this perception. The results suggest that professional barriers are the most prevalent and that the discipline of arts and humanities is where the most obstacles are perceived. In conclusion, there is a need for better professional development for teachers and more institutional involvement through strategic plans.},

As job satisfaction is one of the major factors affecting student achievement as well as student and teacher retention, the identification of the most important satisfaction predictors is crucial. The current study analyzed data from the OECD 2013 Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) via machine learning. In particular, group Mnet (a penalized regression method) was employed in order to consider hundreds of TALIS predictors in one statistical model. Specifically, this study repeated 100 times of variable selection after random data-splitting as well as cross-validation, and presented predictors selected 50% of the time or more. As a result, 18 predictors were identified out of 558, including variables relating to collaborative school climates and teacher self-efficacy, which was consistent with previous research. Newly found variables to teacher job satisfaction included items about teacher feedback, participatory school climates, and perceived barriers to professional development. Suggestions and future research topics are discussed.},

 abstract = {Along with the sociocultural, natural and technogenic life environments in the post-industrial society, the information environment, embodied by the media and the global Internet, is becoming the leading one. In the information environment, individual activity is transferred to the Internet. It includes professional activities mediated by distance technologies, social networking, Internet communities, personal sites, blogs, twitters, collections of scientific, educational, literary and artistic publications, news, movies, concerts, meetings, etc. In this context, the dual social role of the teacher as a provider and, at the same time, consumer of educational services is highlighted. The development of general and professional competencies (especially socio-communicative) affects the success of a teacher in the field of socialization, education and upbringing of young people in the society based on innovations and high technologies. The education system demands a teacher who is able to implement innovative changes in the educational process, requires fundamentally new technological support for innovations and involves the development of the relevant norms of innovative behavior and description of the models, types and methods of disseminating innovative pedagogical experience. Such a teacher meets the requirements of the Russian national project “Our New School” and should be one of the most important resources for modernizing the education system as a whole and, in particular, in terms of continuing professional development. High-quality performance of professional labor functions (training, educating, upbringing) implies the possession of competencies in the analysis, exchange and dissemination of innovative pedagogical technologies. Professional development of a teacher is impossible without the need to transmit the positive experience to wide pedagogical communities.},

 abstract = {Educational institutions are envisioned as principal agents for addressing the current sustainability challenge that society is facing. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is transformational and concerns learning content and outcomes, pedagogy and the learning environment in itself. ESD entails rethinking the learning environment (physical and virtual) in line with sustainable development, which implies classrooms’ transformation towards learner engagement, formative assessments and active methodologies. This paper responds to this need through exploring the relationship between Smart Classrooms and four widely used ESD methodologies (project or problem-based learning, case study, simulation and cooperative inquiry), identifying how the dimensions and categories of the characteristics of Smart Classrooms can contribute and lead to the implementation of ESD methodologies in real teaching practice in an effective way. The method used in this study consisted of a literature review of both theoretical frameworks separately, ESD and Smart Classrooms, and a subsequent expert analysis to identify the interrelation between both. The Smart Classroom shows a high level of adequacy for using problem and project-based learning, case study and cooperative inquiry methods because of its characteristics in terms of technology developments, environmental conditions and processes. Simulation is the ESD methodology with the lowest level of adequacy in a Smart Classroom, because it is primarily held online rather than through face-to-face teaching. Smart Education facilitates the putting in practice of ESD processes as it enables the creation of intelligent, sustainable, resource-efficient, personalised and adaptive learning environments. Further empirical research is needed to explore the influence that the Smart Classroom has in enabling ESD processes and practices, and to identify students’ and teachers’ needs at different education levels. Additionally, teacher training programmes focused on the correct use of Smart Classrooms and on the digital competence of teachers are critical to its successful implementation.},

 abstract = {Based on systematic research of studies published since the year 2000, this comprehensive meta-analysis investigated how the use of technology can enhance learning in secondary school mathematics and science (grade levels 5–13). All studies (k = 92) compared learning outcomes of students using digital tools to those of a control group taught without the use of digital tools. Overall, digital tool use had a positive effect on student learning outcomes (g = 0.65, p < .001). The provision of teacher trainings on digital tool use significantly moderated the overall effect. Use of intelligent tutoring systems or simulations such as dynamic mathematical tools was significantly more beneficial than hypermedia systems. On a descriptive level, the effect size was larger when digital tools were used in addition to other instruction methods and not as a substitute. The results open up new directions for future research and can inform evidence-based decision-making on the use of digital tools in education.},

 abstract = {Research on instructional and learning design is ‘booming’ in Europe, although there has been a move from a focus on content and the way to present it in a formal educational context (i.e., instruction), to a focus on complex learning, learning environments including the workplace, and access to learner data available in these environments. We even see the term ‘learning experience design’ (Neelen and Kirschner 2020) to describe the field. Furthermore, there is an effort to empower teachers (and even students) as designers of learning (including environments and new pedagogies), and to support their reflection on their own practice as part of their professional development (Hansen and Wasson 2016; Luckin et al. 2016; Wasson et al. 2016). While instructional design is an often heard term in the United States and refers to “translating principles of learning and instruction into plans for instructional materials, activities, information resources, and evaluation” (Smith and Ragan 1999), Europe tends to lean more towards learning design as the key for providing efficient, effective, and enjoyable learning experiences. This is not a switch from an instructivist to a constructivist view nor from a teacher-centred to a student-centred paradigm. It is, rather, a different mind-set where the emphasis is on the goal (i.e., learning) rather than the approach (i.e., instruction). Designing learning opportunities in a technology enhanced world builds on theories of human learning and cognition, opportunities provided by technology, and principles of instructional design. New technology both expands and challenges some instructional design principles by opening up new opportunities for distance collaboration, intelligent tutoring and support, seamless and ubiquitous learning and assessment technologies, and tools for thinking and thought. In this article, the authors give an account of their own and other research related to instructional and learning design, highlight related European research, and point to future research directions.},

 abstract = {Resumo O artigo é resultado de uma pesquisa que objetivou analisar a representação social de tecnologia, entre formadores e cursistas, no Núcleo de Tecnologia Educacional em Manaus/AM, bem como suas implicações na formação docente e nos processos de implementação das políticas de inserção da tecnologia no trabalho docente na Amazônia. Destacam-se algumas reflexões acerca da relação entre educação, tecnologia, formação e trabalho docente, considerando sua importância na práxis educativa de educadores (as) da região. Ademais, discutem-se o papel das políticas de incorporação da tecnologia ao trabalho docente e suas implicações na formação de professores. Nesse sentido, foi realizado um estudo empírico fundamentado na Teoria da Representação Social como eixo teórico-metodológico, seus mecanismos de formação e estruturação para apreender a materialidade e a acepção do termo tecnologia. Para tanto, na coleta de dados, foram entrevistados 70 professores participantes do processo de implantação dos Núcleos de Tecnologias Municipais-NTM’s no Estado do Amazonas e foram utilizados os seguintes procedimentos e técnicas: observação sistemática, registro e entrevista semiestruturada, técnicas de associação livre, análise de conteúdo, além dos pressupostos epistemológicos da teoria do habitus de Bourdieu. Os resultados obtidos com o desenvolvimento da pesquisa indicam a coexistência de dois sentidos do termo: a tecnologia como produto (meio material) e como processo (estratégias de gestão, interações e mediações didáticas). Entre as implicações dessas representações na formação docente, destacam-se: a modificação e apreensão das produções simbólicas em torno do objeto tecnologia, embora seus sentidos estejam desconectados das especificidades da região amazônica.
Abstract The article is the result of a research that aimed to analyze the social representation of technology, between trainers and course participants, at the Educational Technology Center in Manaus / State of Amazonas, its implications for teacher training and in the implementation processes of policies for the insertion of technology in teaching work in the Amazon. Some reflections on the relationship between education, technology, training, and teaching work are highlighted, considering its importance in the educational praxis of educators in the region. Nevertheless, it discusses the role of policies for incorporating technology into teaching and its implications for teacher training. In this sense, an empirical study based on the Theory of Social Representation was carried out as a theoretical-methodological axis, its mechanisms of formation and structuring to apprehend the materiality and the meaning of the term technology. For this purpose, in the data collection, 70 teachers participating in the process of implanting the Municipal Technology Centers (MTC’s) in the State of Amazonas were interviewed and the following instruments and techniques were used: systematic observation, registration and semi-structured interview, free association techniques, content analysis, in addition to the epistemological assumptions of Bourdieu’s habitus theory. The results obtained with the development of the research indicate the coexistence of two meanings of the term: technology as a product (material medium) and as a process (management strategies, interactions, and didactic mediations). Among the implications of these representations in teacher training, it stands out: the modification and apprehension of symbolic productions around the object technology, although its senses are disconnected from the specificities of the Amazonian region.},

 abstract = {Science has become a center of knowledge that has contributed greatly to the development of technology. Almost all technology developed and created comes from research carried out on an ongoing basis and using a scientific approach. Science learning is currently developing and adapting to the needs of the times. The development of science occurs by utilizing collaboration with other branches of science such as technology, mechanical engineering, and mathematics. The distinctive feature of collaboration that has become an important value in IR 4.0 also occurs in the field of education. Big Data, as the hallmark of Society 5.0, is the source of big data that makes education more effective and efficient. In addition, the use of Education Technology (EdTech) can also support collaborative transportation and use of data. MEXT (2018) makes a leading project as a form of planning and compilation of science learning towards Society 5.0 through 3 important and essential steps, including: providing diverse opportunities and learning spaces to achieve “fair, individually optimized learning”, ensuring that all students acquire basic academic abilities such as basic reading skills, mathematical thinking, and information literacy skills, are not involved in the humanity or knowledge gap. The success of science learning can be supported by several branches of science such as Physics, Computer science, Natural science, Mathematics and modeling, Teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM-based classroom management, Robotic and game teaching in science education, Instructional technology and application in science education, Training and professional development for STEM teachers, STEM curriculum in science education, Computer-based learning, Learning Innovations and Evaluation, Design and implementation of a technology-rich learning environment, Distance learning on education. Therefore, I thank all participants for International Conference on Science Education and Technology (ICOSETH 2019) who have contributed their research to develop Science education to face Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Society 5.0. I hope, with this kind of collaboration, we can jointly improve the quality of Science education in this era. Editors: Prof. Sulistyo Saputro, M.Si., Ph.D. Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Sajidan, M.Si.

ABSTRACT The article presents an analytical essay on what could be done, in terms of educational activities, in order to avoid a new civilizatory failure, like happened in Auschwitz. Seeks on learning from the paradox experienced in the Third Reich: a German society, well educated and cultured, to have collapsed into barbarism. Therefore, Adorno's concern about this paradox was the central line, in dialogue with authors such as Gramsci, Le Goff, Freire, and Fanon. We reflected upon various aspects that involved Auschwitz, and how an integral human formation could contribute to avoiding new barbarism. We analyzed guidelines present in the National Curricular Guidelines (DCN) for High School, and Human Rights Education; in the High School Teacher Training Material; addressing Gramsci's polytechnic or omnilaterality. We concluded by verifying that the circumstances in Auschwitz have a lot to teach us, as well as, how current the topic is; and, regarding education, that something can be done in order to avoid a new holocaust.Education.

 abstract = {This paper deals with the implementation of personal learning pathways in a technology-enriched environment to enhance learning experiences in initial teacher training. The study uses mixed-methods within a design-based research approach. In a first phase of the approach, the characteristics that personalised learning pathways should meet were identified. In the next stage, the learning sequences’ structure for the pathways was designed, considering context, teaching-learning approach, tasks and assessment. The main result is an interchangeable learning sequence structure prototype that enables the configuration of personalised learning pathways by the students themselves, and the exchange and co-design of learning pathways between different teachers. The students select the sequences from a catalogue, organising their own learning pathways from the combination of different types of sequences offered. This strategy promotes students’ autonomy and self-direction in the learning process, as well as their development of personal information management and collaborative work skills. The conclusion is that the proposed personalized pathways present an adequate balance between the structure, result of the learning design and / or co-design, and the necessary autonomy for the self-direction of their own learning process, whether in individual learning or in the collaborative construction of knowledge. Este trabajo se ocupa de la aplicación de itinerarios personales de aprendizaje en un ambiente enriquecido por tecnología para la mejora de las experiencias de aprendizaje en la formación inicial docente. Se utiliza un enfoque mixto aplicando investigación basada en diseño, para identificar las características que deben reunir los itinerarios personalizados de aprendizaje y diseñar la estructura de secuencias didácticas que configuran dichos itinerarios atendiendo al contexto, al enfoque de enseñanza y aprendizaje, a las tareas y a la evaluación. El principal resultado es un prototipo de estructura intercambiable de secuencia didáctica que permite la configuración de itinerarios personalizados de aprendizaje por parte de los propios estudiantes, al mismo tiempo que el intercambio y co-diseño de itinerarios entre distintos docentes. Los estudiantes seleccionan las secuencias de entre un catálogo de ellas, organizando sus propios itinerarios de aprendizaje a partir de la combinación de diferentes tipos de secuencias ofertadas, promoviendo la autonomía y autodirección del proceso de aprendizaje y el desarrollo de competencias de gestión personal de la información y de trabajo colaborativo por parte de los alumnos. Se concluye que los itinerarios personalizados propuestos presentan un adecuado equilibrio entre la estructura, fruto de la labor de diseño y/o co-diseño didáctico, y la autonomía necesaria para la autodirección del propio proceso de aprendizaje, ya sea en aprendizajes individuales o en la construcción colaborativa del conocimiento.},

 abstract = {Twitter has become a hub for many different types of educational conversations, denoted by hashtags and organized by a variety of affinities. Researchers have described these educational conversations on Twitter as sites for teacher professional development. Here, we studied #Edchat—one of the oldest and busiest Twitter educational hashtags—to examine the content of contributions for evidence of professional purposes. We collected tweets containing the text “#edchat” from October 1, 2017 to June 5, 2018, resulting in a dataset of 1,228,506 unique tweets from 196,263 different contributors. Through initial human-coded content analysis, we sorted a stratified random sample of 1,000 tweets into four inductive categories: tweets demonstrating evidence of different professional purposes related to (a) self, (b) others, (c) mutual engagement, and (d) everything else. We found 65% of the tweets in our #Edchat sample demonstrated purposes related to others, 25% demonstrated purposes related to self, and 4% of tweets demonstrated purposes related to mutual engagement. Our initial method was too time intensive—it would be untenable to collect tweets from 339 known Twitter education hashtags and conduct human-coded content analysis of each. Therefore, we are developing a scalable machine-learning model—a multiclass logistic regression classifier using an input matrix of features such as tweet types, keywords, sentiment, word count, hashtags, hyperlinks, and tweet metadata. The anticipated product of this research—a successful, generalizable machine learning model—would help educators and researchers quickly evaluate Twitter educational hashtags to determine where they might want to engage.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyze the phenomenon of openness in higher education and its trends and technologies of expanding educational opportunities in the digital information society of Moldovan universities. The main concepts of openness in education are associated with the practice of online learning and constructivist approaches, technical optimization of delivering information, continuous professional development and globalization of higher education. Since skilled knowledge becomes the main value of the market, then higher education perspective as a tool of knowledge reproduction is transformed into the basic space of openness and accommodation to innovative use of educational resources. The key issues related to openness in order to impact higher education target the development of Open Educational Resources (OER), as well as implication of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), relatively new online learning trend. There are institutional practices of the adoption and use of open education technologies in some international universities and organizations, which could be extended as well to create an open learning system in the Republic of Moldova, focusing on national practices of education. Openness of Moldovan HEIs is a strategic choice for the future in a rapidly changing educational market that should proliferate.},

 abstract = {This study investigated the fitness of the Factors Influencing Teaching (FIT) Choice scale in a Kurdish educational setting among undergraduate teacher-training students (N=1335) encompassing nursery, primary and secondary education. The factors motivating this population to become teachers were examined in the Iraqi-Kurdish educational context. The-FIT-Choice scale was translated into the Kurdish language and its reliability and validity were measured. Intrinsic/altruistic and social utility values were found to be the most important factors behind the choice of the teaching profession as a career. Intrinsic career value, social contribution, the experience of prior learning and teaching were also influential motivational factors in this choice, as were social influences and social status factors compared to similar research conducted in Australian and Turkish educational settings, however, fall back career, job security, time for family, job transferability, the opportunity to shape the future of children and enhance social equity did not demonstrate meaningful value as motivational factors in this survey. One of the most important results differentiating this from other studies was that the addition of moral value factors to the original scale revealed that these values played an important role in students’ perceptions towards the teaching profession as a career.},

 abstract = {Purpose – the purpose of this research is to review the contents of Latvian teacher training and education programs in order to identify if the development of students’ e-competences is included into these programs as an important objective and value. The importance of the development of these competences has been stressed in various EU documents and scientific literature. The scientific importance of the paper lies in gathering evidence for the inclusion of e-competences into teacher training and education curricula and demonstrating that e-competences have not yet acquired a value status in teacher training and education programs. Research methodology – the methodology included the keyword in context and concordance analysis of self-assessment reports and program descriptions, which were run in the software AntConc. Findings – out of 190,000 word tokens, the KWIC analysis identified only 75 entries related to e-competences, most of which included basic skills of information and communication technologies. Other more advanced concepts, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, adaptive spaces, e-competences, e-education and e-learning, were hardly mentioned. Research limitations – one limitation of this research is the focus on Latvian teacher training and education programs without their comparison to similar European programs, which would allow for determining the competitiveness of such Latvian programs in Europe. Practical implications – the obtained results suggest that the development of e-competences has not been perceived as value in teacher training and education programs in Latvia, and in order to bridge this gap, programming and artificial intelligence courses should be introduced into the curricula of such programs. Originality/Value – the research has demonstrated that the EU aim of boosting the competitiveness of the European education through the development of e-competences is yet to be implemented into teacher training and education programs in Latvia.},

 abstract = {Plants, and the biological systems around them, are key to the future health of the planet and its inhabitants. The Plant Science Decadal Vision 2020-2030 frames our ability to perform vital and far-reaching research in plant systems sciences, essential to how we value participants and apply emerging technologies. We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1-4), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant-based medicines, and "green infrastructure." Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a "parts store" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid-response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non-invasive imaging, sensors, and plug-and-play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence-assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship. This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.},

In HCT, we conducted this study in an effort to sustain success in these global challenging times of crisis that is informed by strategic foresight.HCT called for an all-online delivery starting March 22, 2020 after a two-day pilot in the preceding week. HCT readiness is a result of orchestrating: an ecosystem perspective on digital transformation, a forth-looking institutional strategy that has technology utilization as a major pillar, an education technology strategy, and a comprehensive set of intelligent learning tools.Forward-looking scenarios were designed based on two critical uncertainties: (1) COVID-19 longevity and (2) socio-economic disruption. These scenarios are: Divine Mercy, Recovery Mode, New Norm, and Survival of the Fittest. Subsequently, the features of each scenario are assessed for implications on HCT’s business and support operations, and the proactive strategies are documented to cope with these implications.During the full online delivery mode period, HCT recorded 86% satisfaction amongst its faculty and 54% amongst its student body, delivered 234,000 hours through 61,000 online classes, and delivered over 21,000 hours of online professional development (PD). Over the same period, more than 1900 non-faculty employees have been running business as usual from home.Envisioning future scenarios and preparing the organization for them is a practice that should be deployed in parallel to emergency response efforts to ensure successful business continuity.},

This paper presents the look at the problem from pedagogical perspective. The authors aim to explore the peculiarities of the formation of Ukrainian national identity in native intelligentsia under Ukrainian statelessness in Soviet times using the life and activity of Yurii Stupak as an example. Yurii Stupak is a notable representative of Ukrainian intelligentsia, an educator, scholar, literary studies expert, art critic, local history researcher, the author of numerous works in history of education and ethno-pedagogy. The study uses qualitative methodology and is founded on the laws and categories of scientific research. The researchers applied modern research approaches (personality oriented, cultural, personified, interdisciplinary) and methods (general scientific analysis, comparison, generalization, systematization; textual analysis, elaboration of the source base and historiographical work on the selected problem; the method of retrospective analysis). The authors have established that formation of the personality of Yurii Stupak as a teacher and scholar was influenced by numerous socio-political, socio-economic, cultural-educational and personal factors. The authors prove the decisive impact of family education and learning from nationally conscious teachers at higher education institutions as well as self-education and will for constant personal and professional development on facilitating the continuity of the process of formation of Ukrainian national identity in the native intelligentsia during the investigated period. It is confirmed that national identity does not depend on the existence of sovereign statehood, but it stimulates its revival.},

 abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are becoming more and more useful in many fields of science, including many areas where computational methods are rarely used. High-performance Computing (HPC) is the most powerful solution to get the best results using these algorithms. HPC requires various skills to use. Acquiring this knowledge might be intimidating and take a long time for a researcher with small or no background in information and communications technologies (ICTs), even if the benefits of such knowledge is evident for the researcher. In this work, we aim to assess how a specific method of introducing HPC to such researchers enables them to start using HPC. We gave talks to two groups of non-ICT researchers that introduced basic concepts focusing on the necessary practical steps needed to use HPC on a specific cluster. We also offered hands-on trainings for one of the groups which aimed to guide participants through the first steps of using HPC. Participants filled out questionnaires partly based on Kirkpatrick’s training evaluation model before and after the talk, and after the hands-on training. We found that the talk increased participants’ self-reported likelihood of using HPC in their future research, but this was not significant for the group where participation was voluntary. On the contrary, very few researchers participated in the hands-on training, and for these participants neither the talk, nor the hands-on training changed their self-reported likelihood of using HPC in their future research. We argue that our findings show that academia and researchers would benefit from an environment that not only expects researchers to train themselves, but provides structural support for acquiring new skills.},

 abstract = {Reflecting in written form on one’s teaching enactments has been considered a facilitator for teachers’ professional growth in university-based preservice teacher education. Writing a structured reflection can be facilitated through external feedback. However, researchers noted that feedback in preservice teacher education often relies on holistic, rather than more content-based, analytic feedback because educators oftentimes lack resources (e.g., time) to provide more analytic feedback. To overcome this impediment to feedback for written reflection, advances in computer technology can be of use. Hence, this study sought to utilize techniques of natural language processing and machine learning to train a computer-based classifier that classifies preservice physics teachers’ written reflections on their teaching enactments in a German university teacher education program. To do so, a reflection model was adapted to physics education. It was then tested to what extent the computer-based classifier could accurately classify the elements of the reflection model in segments of preservice physics teachers’ written reflections. Multinomial logistic regression using word count as a predictor was found to yield acceptable average human-computer agreement (F1-score on held-out test dataset of 0.56) so that it might fuel further development towards an automated feedback tool that supplements existing holistic feedback for written reflections with data-based, analytic feedback.},

However, it takes a long time to analyse videos, and teachers are easy to fall into the state of information overload. With the development of “AI + education,” automatic recognition of teacher behavior to support teaching reflection has become an important research topic. In this paper, taking online open classroom teaching video as the data source, we collected and constructed a teacher behavior dataset. Using this dataset, we explored the behavior recognition methods based on RGB video and skeleton information, and the information fusion between them is carried out to improve the recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that the fusion of RGB information and skeleton information can improve the recognition accuracy, and the early-fusion effect is better than the late-fusion effect. This study helps to solve the problems of time-consumption and information overload in teaching reflection and then helps teachers to optimize the teaching strategies and improve the teaching efficiency.},

This data-oriented study follows a quantitative research design. The data is collected through a survey questionnaire from 75 English teachers who are teaching at the university level in five different public and private sector universities in Pakistan. The overall results encourage embedding the knowledge of interculturality in ESL/EFL classes. There is a need to organize training sessions for teachers because many teachers reported that they do not utilize such skills in their ESL/EFL classrooms. In addition, the majority of teachers also believed in employing new approaches for teaching transcultural pragmatics to their students. This study further highlights that teacher/educators could also benefit from working together to develop the teaching of interculturality and transcultural competence, and to make this development happen in relation to teacher professional development.},

Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to leverage new technologies to generate new data and support the advent of precision medicine (PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our disease knowledge and altered diagnosis and treatment approaches resulting in a more precise, predictive, preventative and personalized health care that is customized for the individual patient. Consequently, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to mine such a vast data set. Additionally, personalized medicine promises to revolutionize healthcare, with its key goal of providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time and dose, and thus the potential of improving quality of life and helping to bring down healthcare costs.This policy briefing will look in detail at the issues surrounding continued development, sustained investment, risk factors, testing and approval of innovations for better strategy and faster process. The paper will serve as a policy bridge that is required to enhance a conscious decision among the powers-that-be in Qatar in order to find a way to harmonize multiple strands of activity and responsibility in the health arena. The end goal will be for Qatar to enhance public awareness and engagement and to integrate effectively the incredible advances in research into healthcare systems, for the benefit of all patients.The PM policy briefing provides concrete recommendations on moving forward with PM initiatives in Qatar and internationally. Equally important, integration of PM within a primary care setting, building a coalition of community champions through awareness and advocacy, finally, communicating PM value, patient engagement/empowerment and education/continued professional development programs of the healthcare workforce.Key recommendations for implementation of precision medicine inside and outside Qatar:
Create Community Awareness and PM Education ProgramsEngage and Empower PatientsCommunicate PM ValueDevelop appropriate Infrastructure and Information Management SystemsIntegrate PM into standard Healthcare System and Ensure Access to CarePM is no longer futuristic. It is here. Implementing PM in routine clinical care does require some investment and infrastructure development. Invariably, cost and lack of expertise are cited as barriers to PM implementation. Equally consequential, are the curriculum and professional development of medical care experts.Policymakers need to lead and coordinate effort among stakeholders and consider cultural and faith perspectives to ensure success. It is essential that policymakers integrate PM approaches into national strategies to improve health and health care for all, and to drive towards the future of medicine precision health.},

 abstract = {This paper is in response to the manuscript entitled “Designing for 21st century learning online: a heuristic method to enable educator learning support roles” (Nacu et al., in Educ Technol Res Dev 66:1029–1049, 2018) from an inclusion perspective. In today’s world, given the central importance of online learning to diverse students and educators, there is a critical need for clear descriptions of adult educator support roles in online education as well as convenient and insightful assessment methods of online learning platforms. Heuristic evaluation of an online learning platform allowed for inexpensive and useful understandings of adult support roles in an online social learning platform. More detailed evaluation of online learning interactions could be useful in deepening understandings about student interactions, their prior experiences, and educator feedback. Educator support roles are key to fostering inclusion in student learning communities in online settings just as they are in classroom settings. This paper describes specific roles that are important and raises questions about system design and professional development that all online learning platforms should consider. Further study of varied aspects of system design and of educator professional development is also recommended. Educator support roles in online learning represent an important field of study, especially as it relates to supporting learning by all children inclusively.},

 abstract = {The present work aims to analyze the relationship of ICT with neuroeducation, educational inclusion, environmental education and pluriculturality through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (Structural Equation Model – SEM) of a created ad hoc and a validated and confirmed scale. For the search for answers, a non-experimental, descriptive, explanatory and correlational research process was carried out. The instrument used to collect the data was a Likert scale, which has been validated in content and with a good Cronbach's alpha (.825). The construct validity was carried out with an exploratory factorial analysis (KMO (.764), Bartlett (Sign.000), Determinant (2.891E-30)). The sample was of 292 students of Master’s Degree in Teacher Training from the University of Jaen (Spain). The Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (SEM) allowed us to conclude that this relationship is possible, with greater strength between education technologies and educational inclusion, and between the former and pluriculturality, and with less strength between environmental education and neuroeducation, what should be taken into account to implement in university training programs.  },

 abstract = {Statement of the problem. In the process of systemic developments in engineering education, the role of a technical university teacher increases. Changes in the requirements imposed by international and Russian communities to the quality of engineering education in the context of digital transformation of the economy and higher education mainstream the problem of continuous professional development of an engineering university teacher. Currently, a teacher of professional education should acquire new methods and digital tools, develop new competencies among students, i.e. “skills of the 21st century” and digital literacy. Training engineering personnel pressure the need for a professional education teacher to learn new pedagogical technologies and digital tools directly in the context of their professional activities. The pedagogical, technological and organizational conditions of such integration have not yet been sufficiently studied in educational practice and pedagogical science. The purpose of the article is to present the author’s approaches to and developments of modeling programs and digital educational environment for pedagogical training of a Master’s degree student in engineering education in the context of modern pedagogical technologies aimed at developing skills of the 21st century. The research methodology and methods are based on a transprofessional approach to the system of professional education; on the analysis of international and Russian studies to identify the structure of basic skills of the 21st century, the means and methods of their formation in Master’s education. Research results. The interrelations are grounded and expanded of the 21st century skills and universal competencies acquired by a graduate of higher professional education at the level of a Master’s degree in Engineering. The basic principles of designing the digital educational environment as a condition for integrating pedagogical and engineering training are revealed. The authors’ programs have been developed for the system of specialized courses in Master’s engineering training aimed at learning the technologies of soft skills formation and ways of their implementation in traditional training sessions. An open information resource (an online course) “Pedagogical Soft-Skills Navigator” has been developed to guide teachers and undergraduates through the soft skills formation technologies. Conclusion. Implementation of the developed programs in the digital educational environment of an open online course makes it possible to acquire the technologies of soft skills formation in personalized learning models, aimed at the needs of professional teaching and the focus of a Master’s program. The developed materials can be used in professional development programs for teachers of professional higher education.},

 abstract = {The study identifies the term intercultural competence and distinguishes its main components. The authors examine the experience of Great Britain in the formation of this competence among schoolchildren in the historical perspective from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present. The study of the main methods used in multicultural classes in Great Britain and in many countries of Europe made it possible to group them according to the components of intercultural competence. In order to identify the level of development of this competence among future teachers themselves, there were interviewed the students of Ulyanovsk State Pedagogical University named after I.N. Ulyanov. The diagnostic assessment was also conducted for British students who showed a significantly higher level of tolerance compared to Russian students. Therefore, it was thought appropriate to refer to the experience of teacher training in Great Britain that has developed a certain system of training future teachers who are ready to work in a multicultural environment. The comparative analysis of the curricula of 15 leading universities in Great Britain revealed a number of features in teacher training, including the development of their readiness to work in a multicultural educational environment. The experience of Great Britain in the formation of intercultural competence among schoolchildren and future teachers made it possible to determine the directions and trends of their development in modern Russian education at two levels: at the level of school education and at the level of higher education related to the preparation of teachers for work in multicultural classes.},

 abstract = {  Purpose. STEM education (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) has a comprehensive approach to teacher training, which allows the future teacher to provide modern technologies for teaching students in engineering and natural science areas. The authors aim to analyze the prospects for developing a pedagogical STEM education system, to study the attitude of physics teachers to the STEM approach in schools in the Tomsk region. Methodology. During the study, the analysis of Russian and international resources on the relevance and development of educational technologies for STEM education was initially carried out. The survey and statistical processing of the answers from physics teachers and methodologists from 57 general educational institutions in the Tomsk region, clustering of narrow and specific answers from respondents, and a generalization of the results were carried out. Results. It is found that new requirements for the content of education in the field of natural sciences show the need for teacher training in STEM education technologies, focused on solving practical and project problems. It is proved that for the full implementation of the STEM approach during the teacher training courses, generalized representations of theoretical and empirical research are necessary. It is revealed that various types of approaches to STEM education are represented in the region. Physics teachers have a strong interest to be engaged in STEM education. Preference is given to the option when implementing the STEM classes with students in a separate integrated course while maintaining the orthodox physics course. Practical implications. The results of the study can be applied in the system of higher pedagogical education for the development of integrated courses of natural sciences and “technology” for the bachelor’s degree students, and the development of master’s degree programs for teachers on the theory and practice of STEM education for schoolchildren.},

 abstract = {This paper presents evidence on the impact of technology-aided instruction on literacy using an AI-based multi-sensory technology platform across a large cross-section of government schools in India. The study focused on reading and comprehension in the English language. The intervention enhances the instructional effectiveness of the teachers and the learning ability of the children within the existing instructional environment without any new instructional design or pedagogy or content. Besides, the intervention is implemented by existing teachers and not outside volunteers. A total of 1 million children and 15,000 teachers across 5000 government schools in the states of Maharashtra, West Bengal, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Gujarat and Karnataka used the technology for the 2016-17 academic year. Using a randomized control-treatment assessment, the study finds a 20–40% overall gain in learning outcomes in the treatment sample. Gains within individual states and grades vary. Learning outcomes rose across the entire range of proficiency levels in a grade. Ongoing self-administered assessments report even higher impact in the 50–60% range. In addition, teachers also reported improving their skills as a result of using the technology, suggesting that the intervention can also alleviate teacher shortage and inadequate teacher training. The paper also reports briefly on the growing adoption of the program in several countries outside India.

 abstract = {None of the papers presented here reflects on the Pandemic situation. In due time, journals will be filled with research papers on the effects and workings of the Pandemic for academics, students and organizations in higher education. One general theme will be if the changed contexts for teaching and learning we have seen in the time span from February/March 2020 until the present situation will throw significant light into how the future will be. In a report presented by the US organization EDUCAUSE, well before the pandemic, the following trends were foreshadowed: In the social domain, wellbeing and mental health, demographic changes and equity and fairness will be high on the agenda. In the technological domain, AI, new digital learning environment, and leaning analytics and privacy questions will cause concern. In the economic domain, cost, adjustment to the labour market and climate change will take foreground. In the political domain, decreasing funding, estimation of value of higher education and political polarization will need attention. Finally, the dynamics of higher education itself will influence our path to the future: changes in student population, alternative pathways to education and online education. None of these forecasts anticipated the demands of a rapidly evolving pandemic globally. The latter points of the list provided by EDUCAUSE have been the focus of this journal over the last 17 years. We have seen trends come and pass, and watched trends oscillate with the shifts of fashion. In our experience we see that global actors take over the market: Blackboard, Moodle and Canvas. ZOOM and Webex are winning similar positions and a host of add-ons and potentially brilliant contenders try to gain the same advantages. One example comes to mind: one software – no name mentioned – cost a Norwegian institution nkr 30 000 for a license for a studentbody of 40 000 – before the pandemic. After the pandemic, the price for a smaller institution with a studentbody of 15 000, has risen to nkr. 350 000. Another example: the realization of strict GDPR regulations in Europe hampers the use of software in significant ways. The main VLE/LMS-configurations are affected by the different GDPR-arrangements in US vs. other continent and states. The global market for educational software are seriously affected by the globalization and the escalating disharmonies in international collaboration. It does not help that some providers act like profiteers at this time and age. In this edition of our seventeenth volume we offer five articles. In the first, Marcia Håkansson Lindqvist of Mid Sweden University, contributes with an analysis of one Swedish one-to-one laptop initiative. Her take is on how parents conceive of this phenomenon. She describes how the initiative was a mixed blessing, and one sees easily its applicability to the present condition for most student. In the second paper, Rob Miles, of the United Arab Emirates University, has written the paper: “Identifying the contradictions in the technology enhanced language classroom”. It contains an account of a theoretically sophisticated – and highly critical research project in a region not often reported from in Northern academic journals. The paper questions the positive impact of a 1:1 laptop initiative in a context quite different from the Swedish example. Tor Jørgen Schjelde and Ingrid Nilsen Lie of Tromsø University, the Arctic University, present the third paper: “The impact of emotions on learning and motivation in producing and presenting digital stories.” Digital stories have been a strong interest for this journal over the years, and their paper opens new avenues of research into the role of emotional engagement in the production – and reception of digital stories. Three authors, Reidun Lied, Hanne Maria Bingen of VID specialized University and Simen A. Steindal of Lovisenberg Diaconal University College present the paper: “Collaborative Online Learning Using a Blended Learning Design for a Physiology Course in Nursing Education”. It describes an implementation of Salmon’s model for online collaborative learning in a blended learning context for part-time nursing students. Salmon’s model is widely used and is here contesting its applicability for this group of students. Last, Brita Bjørkelo of Norwegian Police University College/University of Bergen, Aslaug Grov Almås of Western Norway University of Applied Sciences and Ingrid Helleve of the University of Bergen present their joint paper: “Perceived adequate education in ethics:A way to tap into ethical Social Networking Sites awareness?”. It provides a very good argument for applied training in ethical issues in teacher training also will prepare them for counteracting illegitimate student use of Social Network Sites.},

Abstract: This research seeks to determine standards of technological mastery that should be available in the university professor in the 21st century, and seeks to explore the opinions of the 214 members of the University staff of Hodeida on the importance of these standards. The researcher used the descriptive method, built a proposed list of criteria and presented it to a number of experts. In the light of the list, a questionnaire was constructed to collect data from (6) domains, (14) criteria and (74) indicators. The results of the study have given great importance to the list of standards, particularly the areas of knowledge framework, the fundamentals of communication and education technology, intellectual, ethical and legal issues related to technology, data and analysis methods, and continuous professional development, And it given an intermediate importance for the use of technology in the implementation of the educational process and technological communication tools. The variables of the academic rank, the country of graduation and the computer experience of the study members did not affect the importance of the availability of the criteria in the university professor, but the variable of the type of college to which the members belong affects the importance of availability of standards in the university professor and in favor of the scientific and educational faculties},

 abstract = {Despite the critical role of teachers in the educational process, few advanced learning technologies have been developed to support teacher-instruction or professional development. This lack of support is particularly acute for middle school math teachers, where only 37% felt well prepared to scaffold instruction to address the needs of diverse students in a national sample. To address this gap, the Advancing Middle School Teachers’ Understanding of Proportional Reasoning project is researching techniques to apply pedagogical virtual agents and dialog-based tutoring to enhance teachers' content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. This paper describes the design of a conversational, agent-based intelligent tutoring system to support teachers' professional development. Pedagogical strategies are presented that leverage a virtual human facilitator to tutor pedagogical content knowledge (how to teach proportions to students), as opposed to content knowledge (understanding proportions). The roles for different virtual facilitator capabilities are presented, including embedding actions into virtual agent dialog, open-response versus choice-based tutoring, ungraded pop-up sub-activities (e.g. whiteboard, calculator, note-taking). Usability feedback for a small cohort of instructors pursuing graduate studies was collected. In this feedback, teachers rated the system ease of use and perceived usefulness moderately well, but also reported confusion about what to expect from the system in terms of flow between lessons and support by the facilitator.},

 abstract = {There is an assumption that graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) have mastery of the chemistry content they are teaching and preparation to instruct students. However, in reformed classrooms, GTAs may need more support and resources. We designed chemistry rehearsal modules for use in a mixed-reality teaching simulator to help prepare GTAs for instruction in reformed classrooms by targeting pedagogical skills. The modules included familiar curricular activities and research-based student conceptions. We conducted an exploratory study with three experienced GTAs to investigate the utilization of the module inside the simulator. The three GTAs practiced cold calling and error framing and participated in a 1-h interview based on their experience. We recorded, transcribed, and coded the interviews and the simulator sessions. The three GTAs implemented the skills and provided feedback that supported the use of the module in the simulator and the authentic nature of the practice. Simulated environments that encourage personalized learning, skill practice, and responding to literature-based student ideas provide a promising avenue for graduate teaching assistant professional development.},

This process is characterized by the increasing role of education in all spheres of human activity and the increasing importance of artificial intelligence and communications. One of the key areas of informatization is the addition of education to new theories and practices that are aimed at using advanced information technologies for the purpose of teaching and teaching the modern generation. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are a form of informatization. On the other hand, now they are actively being introduced into the educational process as teaching aids. The successful implementation of informatization is largely determined by the human and material potential of educational institutions and the degree of teacher training. The process of introducing ICT into practice is chaotic, but today there is a pattern in it, and researchers around the world find and explore it.},

 abstract = {Economies of the world and workforce level of skills are changing rapidly. Industrial revaluations and knowledge economies have raised the demand for a knowledgeable and digitally equipped skilled workforce. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is an educational stream that provides vocational skills to youth and produces a skilled workforce for the industry. The role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the TVET pedagogy, training delivery, teachers training, curriculum, and labs is need of the day to meet current era challenges. In the TVET education training cycle, the level of ICT enablement is required to be reviewed. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) evaluates literature for innovation of ICT in TVET education for the last ten years. This study aims to identify and present ICT-based technology innovations, research, and applications used in TVET training cycle system components/functional areas to identify gaps for future research directions/agenda. This gap identification will help (i) TVET training institutes to upgrade their teachers, curriculum, labs and, equipment, (ii) policymakers to devise technology-oriented skilled workforce development policies, (iii) to provide guidelines to industry, researchers, and academics to focus on gaps to address future challenges of workforce development. Based on the search string, we found 2,445 relevant documents and after applying quality assurance and inclusion/exclusion criteria, finally, 134 documents were selected for the study and analyzed. The result of this systematic literature review identifies that ICT technologies and application dispersion into TVET training cycle system components/functional areas is very low particularly in monitoring and evaluation, career guidance and job placement, trainee’s assessment, and teacher’s training. TVET Technology index suggests that much focus is needed on IoT, Robotics, Data Science, Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and other similar technology induction to all TVET training.},

 abstract = {The article substantiates the theoretical prerequisites for training future primary school teachers to form students’ media educational skills. The development of new technologies necessitates managing information, choosing the primary information from a large flow within minimal time. The digitalization of society requires a person to be able to work correctly with media resources. Massive information flow covers all areas of human life, and the main difficulty is not to obtain specific information but to determine which information is needed. Because many current media do not verify the authenticity of the data published, manipulative technologies are spreading. Currently, the purpose of higher educational establishments is to train an educated specialist, who should be focused on lifelong learning and his or her ongoing personal and professional development. To be able to develop students’ media educational skills, teachers themselves need to be media-competent. Media competence affects students' professional competence and ensures the development of critical and analytical thinking. Pedagogical institutions of higher education are designed to provide future teachers with a high level of professional media knowledge and media skills to form a creative personality of a modern teacher, capable of research and innovation. In higher educational establishments of Ukraine, there have been revealed a number of problems related to the lack of orientation of the educational process on the professional training of future teachers to form media educational skills of students, namely: weak motivation of students to acquire media academic knowledge; episodic application of media educational technologies in the educational process; lack of future teachers’ interest in improving their level of media competence; insufficient level of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, associated with the effective use of media education, their didactic capabilities and functions; future teachers do not have the desire to improve their knowledge and skills through the use of media education technologies.},

This paper analyzes the use of AI for student assessment based on a systematic review. For this purpose, a search was carried out in two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 454 papers were found and, after analyzing them according to the PRISMA Statement, a total of 22 papers were selected. It is clear from the studies analyzed that, in most of them, the pedagogy underlying the educational action is not reflected. Similarly, formative evaluation seems to be the main use of AI. Another of the main functionalities of AI in assessment is for the automatic grading of students. Several studies analyze the differences between the use of AI and its non-use. We discuss the results and conclude the need for teacher training and further research to understand the possibilities of AI in educational assessment, mainly in other educational levels than higher education. Moreover, it is necessary to increase the wealth of research which focuses on educational aspects more than technical development around AI.},

 abstract = {The transition to the assessment of entrustable professional activities as part of competency-based medical education (CBME) has substantially increased the number of assessments completed on each trainee. Many CBME programs are having difficulty synthesizing the increased amount of assessment data. Learning analytics are a way of addressing this by systematically drawing inferences from large datasets to support trainee learning, faculty development, and program evaluation. Early work in this field has tended to emphasize the significant potential of analytics in medical education. However, concerns have been raised regarding data security, data ownership, validity, and other issues that could transform these dreams into nightmares. In this paper, the authors explore these contrasting perspectives by alternately describing utopian and dystopian futures for learning analytics within CBME. Seeing learning analytics as an important way to maximize the value of CBME assessment data for organizational development, they argue that their implementation should continue within the guidance of an ethical framework.},

This study investigates the attitudes of 899 Austrian pre-service teachers towards inclusion using a revised version of the Attitudes to Inclusion Scale (AIS). The psychometric quality of the revised scale was examined. The results indicated a high reliability, and the two-dimensional factor structure was confirmed by a confirmatory factor analysis. Some evidence for convergent validity was found.

 abstract = {This research paper’s aim was to investigate both the pre-service teachers’ perceptions of their digital competence and if gender, type of the bachelor’s degree and age made the opinions different or not. To do so, the clustering analysis method was employed to analyze the areas and items of the digital competence questionnaires used as a data collection technique. The study group included 291 participants who are now teacher-trainees in Draa-Tafilalte Regional Teacher-Training Center in Errachidia and Ouarzazate in the south-east of Morocco. In so doing, a number of results attained and basically confirmed that the level of the teacher-trainees’ digital competence was low or weak and that the three parameters (the type of the bachelor’s degree, gender and age) played a significant role in shaping different opinions on their digital competence. This paper ended with some major implications that were drawn from the findings of this study in our bid to highlight some needs of the pre-service teachers that should be met in their training courses and related activities to develop their digital competence in teaching and learning process.},

 abstract = {High levels of school dropout are a major burden on the educational and professional development of a country’s inhabitants. A country’s prosperity depends, among other factors, on its ability to produce higher education graduates capable of moving a country forward. To alleviate the dropout problem, more and more institutions are turning to the possibilities that artificial intelligence can provide to predict dropout as early as possible. The difficulty of accessing personal data and privacy issues that it entails force the institutions to rely on the Academic Data of their students to create accurate and reliable predictive systems. This work focuses on creating the best possible predictive model based solely on academic data, and accordingly, its capacity to infer knowledge must be maximised. Thus, Feature Engineering and Instance Engineering techniques such as dealing with redundancy, significance of the features, correlation, cardinality features, missing values, creation or elimination of features, data fusion, removal of unuseful instances, binning, resampling, normalisation, or encoding are applied in detail before the construction of well-known models such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine along with an Ensemble of them at different stages: prior to enrolment, at the end of the first semester, at the end of the second semester, at the end of the third semester, and at the end of the fourth semester. Through the construction of these predictive models that serve as inputs to a decision support system, the application of effective dropout prevention policies can be applied.},

 abstract = { Background/Context Blended learning—a learning model in which online learning is combined with face-to-face instruction to provide a more personalized learning experience for students—has shown enormous growth in recent years. Though many policymakers and educators are optimistic about the potential of blended learning to provide the type of personalized education encouraged by current policy (Race to the Top, ConnectED, etc.), few studies have investigated blended learning in K—12 contexts beyond questions of effects.   Purpose/Objective This qualitative case study examines the execution of a blended school model to understand teachers’ roles and practices in that environment. In this article, Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) provides the framework for tracing how instructional practices and teachers’ roles develop throughout the first year of the school and for understanding how contextual factors interact to influence this development.   Research Design This article reports findings from the first year of an ongoing qualitative case study, designed to examine teachers’ instructional roles and practices in a blended charter high school. The research team collected a variety of data in order to garner a rich, deep understanding of the contextualized experiences of teachers, including more than 60 observations; two rounds of interviews; and a year's worth of email correspondence, documents, and artifacts.   Conclusions/Recommendations The original vision for teacher practice broke down to varying levels in each classroom, with all teachers exhibiting a return to the pedagogical roles and practices with which they were most comfortable. The tensions, frustrations, and contradictions experienced by teachers throughout the year demonstrate the need for better planning and professional development prior to the full enactment of a new school model, particularly one in which technology plays a large role. For example, administrators and teachers must address how teachers will know that students are using technology productively. Further, because teachers’ roles may change in a blended school, these roles need to be defined, and teachers need to be provided with support and training around these roles first, before the students show up. In addition, if an online curriculum is expected to bear the responsibility of assessment and data production, it must first be vetted to ensure that the assessments are rigorous and the data is accurate. Finally, there needs to be planning around how the classroom space should be organized to promote learning, how students will be trained to self-direct, and how teachers will facilitate learning. },

 abstract = {Personalized Learning (PL) is an educational approach that tailors instruction to the academic needs of each student. Most research on PL focuses on student achievement, technology, and implementation challenges. Little research has been conducted on the actual practices that teachers use to personalize instruction and on students’ and teachers’ feelings about being in a school that implements PL. I conducted a case study at a recently opened rural elementary charter school in the southern United States, which was implementing PL schoolwide. After attending a professional development workshop on PL hosted by the State Department of Education, I conducted classroom observations in a first - grade and a fifth/sixth - grade classroom. I interviewed the teachers of these classes, the school principal, and three students. Three themes emerged from my analysis of this material, relating to student engagement, teacher behaviors and dispositions, and student outcomes. Overall, I concluded that PL is not a quick or easy transition for a school to make, nor does it involve just changing the curriculum to individualize instruction for students. Personalized Learning requires an adaption of teacher and student mindsets and the development of a school culture that fosters both academic and social - emotional growth among the students.},

 abstract = {The teaching of machine learning is now considered essential and relevant in schools globally. Despite the ongoing discourse and increased research in the emerging field, teachers' conceptions of machine learning remain under-researched. This study aims at filling the gap by describing the initial conceptions of teaching machine learning by 12 African in-service teachers. We detailed the result of a phenomenographic analysis of teachers' pre-conceptions on teaching machine learning in K-12 settings. Twelve high school (Grades 10–12) computer science teachers in some selected African countries were recruited for a semi-structured interview. Five categories emerged from the analysis of the semi-structured interviews as follows: supporting student technical knowledge, having knowledge of the concept, focusing on professional development practices, contextualizing teaching resources and tools, and sustainability for development goals. These involve the relevance of teaching machine learning, the pedagogical approaches, strategies, and sustainability relating to practical implementation in schools. The results suggest the need to train in-service teachers to use existing tools designed for introducing machine learning. The teachers should also be involved in the co-designing process of resources considering contextual factors and, significantly, the curriculum to integrate machine learning into mainstream education. Involving teachers in the development process would help contextualize machine learning, contributing to real impact and societal changes.},

 abstract = {Background:  The term computational thinking offers a new approach in the field of cognitive science, through the premise of systematizing the steps of problem solving that it can be applied in Artificial Intelligence and to other sciences. Objectives: Offer to participants a continuous training in the context of computational thinking and evaluate the impact of understanding these teachers about their respective concepts and practices. Design: Of a qualitative nature, involving specific dynamics of action-research, the design of the teaching experience involves the elaboration of tasks, used as a teaching hypothesis, subject to reassessments and readjustments. Settings and participants: In remote context, through the Teams platform, with twelve primary and higher schoolteachers from Brazil, Portugal, Cape Verde and Angola. Data collection and Analysis : Data obtained through the recordings of the meetings and the proposals of the participants, analyzed according to the four phases of the reflexive spiral and the expansive cycle. Results: The contributions and involvement of the teachers were significant, and some proposals of activities conceived, two of them presented in this article. Conclusions: With the partial results obtained it is expected that the insertion of computational thinking in basic education develops skills of different abstraction, which helps children in solving problems in all areas of life, not only in the use of computers or for future computer scientists. The participants' proposals will be published and made available online, to contribute to teacher training in the context of computational thinking.},

 abstract = {Computer-based learning environments serve as a valuable asset to help strengthen teacher preparation and preservice teacher self-regulated learning. One of the most important advantages is the opportunity to collect ambient data unobtrusively as observable indicators of cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes that mediate learning and performance. Ambient data refers to teacher interactions with the user interface that include but are not limited to timestamped clickstream data, keystroke and navigation events, as well as document views. We review the claim that computers designed as metacognitive tools can leverage the data to serve not only teachers in attaining the aims of instruction, but also researchers in gaining insights into teacher professional development. In our presentation of this claim, we review the current state of research and development of a network-based tutoring system called nBrowser, designed to support teacher instructional planning and technology integration. Network-based tutors are self-improving systems that continually adjust instructional decision-making based on the collective behaviors of communities of learners. A large part of the artificial intelligence resides in semantic web mining, natural language processing, and network algorithms. We discuss the implications of our findings to advance research into preservice teacher self-regulated learning.},

The experiment using 3 levels of triggerfish addition; 0%, 20%, and 40% respectively. The result of experiments that have been conducted on 30 respondents who are the students at Faculty of Teacher Training and Education by using 5 levels of hedonic scale shows that the opak crackers with the addition of triggerfish is the most preferable and the experiment proves that the nutritional level increased as well. The result of the acceptance showed that almost all consumers like opak Crackers in the (AI) treatment with the addition of 20% triggerfish because it had triggerfish characteristics such as aroma, crunchy texture, and the taste. However, when it comes for the color, respondents preferred the A0 formula, which is the crackers without the addition of triggerfish. The proximate test result reveals that the triggerfish opak crackers contains 83.32% carbohydrate, 8.42% protein, 1.99% fat, 0.47% ash, and 3% water.},

Since the platform launched in late 2015, the Smithsonian Office of Education Technology has engaged more than 20,000 educators on the use of the SLL through PD that was offered both in-person and digitally, synchronously and asynchronously, frequently through partners within the network of Smithsonian Affiliate museums. Results from more than 1,100 aggregated surveys, 50 in-depth interviews, and five focus groups were triangulated and demonstrated that PD was associated with increased participants’ awareness of, skills in, and frequency in using the SLL, creating, and sharing content, and overall satisfaction with the platform. Educators, especially those who participated in PD, agreed with statements about successfully achieving student learning outcomes when using SLL in classrooms. Findings highlighted the importance of cultivating long-term, supportive relationships with PD participants and partners and offering consistently available support with museum staff well beyond the workshops. They also pointed to the value of user-centered marketing research and strategies to broaden the reach of digital learning resources. As museums and cultural organizations work to meet the increasing demand to engage educators digitally, these concrete lessons can be adapted and applied to institutions that provide access to digital resources to educators.},

 abstract = {e4988058 Distance education (EAD) is based on the interaction between students and teachers, engaged in a link that determines the access that leads to this process of teaching and knowledge. In this scenario, tutoring stands out as one of the most relevant issues to be studied and addressed, as there is a need to train these professionals to work in this type of teaching. Thus, the research aims to analyze the role of online tutoring and its interactions (narratives) in an elective discipline of the classroom Pedagogy course, from a public higher education institution in the state of Alagoas, in the understanding of its students. With a qualitative approach and exploratory character, the research had as subjects seven students of the course. The instruments of data collection were: questionnaire and observation of interactions (narratives) of students in the forums. The analysis took place in an interpretative way using the Sobek software to assist in the analysis, following the categories: tutoring; interactions in the virtual learning environment; teacher-tutor interaction and students. For students, the experience of acting in tutoring was a moment of learning about this role; considered that in some mini courses there was not; emphasized that the role of tutoring is ingrained in mediating the knowledge of EAD students. It is relevant to reflect on the inclusion of disciplines on distance learning in the curriculum of universities, in the process of initial teacher training. Resumo A educação a distância (EAD) está fundamentada na interação entre os estudantes e professores, engajados num elo que determina o acesso nesse processo de ensino e conhecimento. Nesse cenário, a tutoria se destaca como uma das relevantes questões a ser estudada e abordada, pois, há a necessidade de formar esses profissionais para atuarem nessa modalidade de ensino. Diante disso, o artigo tem o objetivo analisar o papel da tutoria online e suas interações de narrativas, de acordo com a compreensão dos estudantes em uma disciplina eletiva do curso de Pedagogia, na modalidade presencial, de uma instituição de ensino superior (IES) pública do estado de Alagoas. De abordagem qualitativa e caráter exploratório, o estudo teve como sujeitos, sete estudantes do referido curso. Os instrumentos de coleta de dados foram: questionário e observação das interações dos estudantes nos fóruns. A análise se deu de forma interpretativa utilizando-se do software Sobek para auxiliar na análise, seguindo as categorias: tutoria; interações no ambiente virtual de aprendizagem (AVA); interação professor-tutor e estudantes. O estudo mostrou que para os estudantes, a experiência de atuar na tutoria foi um momento de aprendizagem sobre esse papel; consideraram que em alguns momentos não houve interações entre eles; enfatizaram que o papel da tutoria está arraigado na mediação do conhecimento do aluno da EAD. Torna-se relevante refletir sobre a inserção de disciplinas EAD no currículo das universidades, no processo de formação inicial dos professores.

 abstract = {The competency-based approach is currently introduced throughout the whole pre-school education system, and this process reveals the uncertainty, doubts, confusion, and unpreparedness of teachers for the implementation of this task. It also highlights the need to provide new guidance for the professional development of in-service teachers. The article presents the results of a survey on the professional needs of pre-school teachers for implementing a competency-based approach. The research data is obtained from focus group discussions, teacher surveys, and self-assessments from teachers’ professional development courses. The research data shows that the most topical professional development needs of pre-school teachers are linked to the need for an in-depth understanding of such components of competency-based approach as equity, meaningful assessment, personalized learning, transversal skills, and learning environments, allowing to identify the tasks for the professional development of teachers to promote a common understanding for implementing a competency-based approach in pre-school education.   Keywords: competence; competency-based approach; professional development; professional needs; pre-school teachers},

 abstract = {The aim of the article is to analyze the results of teaching the subject «Fundamentals of Health» in grades 5-9 in the conditions of distance learning with the application of cloud technologies. The following methods were used for the study: videoconferences, explanations, interviews, surveys, tests for formative and summative assessment, performing practical tasks, works, projects, compiling instructions to tasks, creating educational presentations and videos. The article substantiates the possibility of teaching the subject «Fundamentals of Health» in grades 5-9 using cloud technology and educational platforms in the conditions of distance learning, such as: Google Classroom, Zoom, Meet, Edpuzzle. The results of 5-9-grade students’ academic performance were analyzed and it was found that grades 5, 6, and 9 showed a fairly high level of academic achievement, while for the students of 7th and 8th grades this indicator was quite low. The obtained results are explained by the difference in motivation, experience of blended learning and students’ age psychological peculiarities, parents’ inclusion in the educational process, various types of practical tasks. The prospects for further use of distance education are highlighted in the article. They include application of tried and tested cloud technologies, systematic and comprehensive professional development of teachers; teacher-parent cooperation, preparing guidelines for students’ parents; adapting types of tasks and their content to the conditions of distance and blended learning; launching teachers’ own YouTube channels.},

 abstract = {The idea of using the capabilities of artificial intelligence for the needs of the educational process is not new for modern pedagogy, but its development before the Corona time was rather fragmented. The conditions of the pandemic, self-isolation and protracted quarantine forced to look for new opportunities and forms to continue the educational process in this situation. And here the possibilities of organizing the educational process for all levels of education using artificial intelligence came to the fore. The purpose of this article is to analyze the forms of using the capabilities of artificial intelligence to organize the educational process for primary school students, that became more active because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using of unique personal teaching methods (UPTM) at schooling always considered to be a sign of identity and elitism of educational process in a particular country. UPTM, on the one hand, are more consistent with the needs of the country and society in preparing the younger generation. On the other hand, this is the possibility of a narrow specification of the educational process. In the process of writing the article, empirical and theoretical research methods were used, that is typical for scientific studies of this kind. As the result, it can be noted that the Quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic played a favorable role in expanding the range of possibilities for using artificial intelligence in the field of education, even in those areas that were traditionally considered to be unsuitable or non-effective for it due to the peculiarities of educational tasks. The study is made as a part of «A Comparative Study on Professional Development of Primary School Teachers in China and South Korea» research program (registration number ZKNUC2017038)},

There are instances that prevent the entire manifestation of the character, his/her self-achievement, self-expression and self-agency. Such instances are barriers that accompany the educational procedure. The aim of the research is to give theoretical substantiation and offer the pedagogical technology, which provides future teachers’ training to application of cognitive barriers in their professional activities in terms of the pandemic caused by Covid-19. The main hypothesis of the research is the idea that specially organized future teachers’ training focusing on the formation of their competence in application of cognitive barriers is the basis of their successful professional activities. The research methodology is built on the dialectical unity of such methods: comparative historical method, genetic method, competence-based method, systemic method, synergetic method. The proposed technology is built on the general didactic and specific principles and is accomplished via motivational, procedural, stage of obtaining of experience, analytical and reflexive stages involving appropriate strategies and tactics. It provides the result in formation of future teachers’ competence in application of cognitive barriers in professional activities.},

Our analysis showed that AI offers teachers several opportunities for improved planning (e.g., by defining students’ needs and familiarizing teachers with such needs), implementation (e.g., through immediate feedback and teacher intervention), and assessment (e.g., through automated essay scoring) of their teaching. We also found that teachers have various roles in the development of AI technology. These roles include acting as models for training AI algorithms and participating in AI development by checking the accuracy of AI automated assessment systems. Our findings further underlined several challenges in AI implementation in teaching practice, which provide guidelines for developing the field.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) teaching is becoming an increasingly popular topic among educators and researchers, but the research on AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms was under-explored. Currently, most studies examine the curriculum content of the United States and the European countries. However, there has been limited research on AI learning design and activities in the Asia-Pacific region. This meta-review examined 14 research papers on AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms that were taken in the Asia-Pacific region from 2018 to 2021 by identifying the content knowledge, tools, platforms, activities, theories and models, assessment methods, and learning outcomes of the selected studies. The results indicated that AI curricula can develop students' AI knowledge and skills, learning attitudes, and interests. Furthermore, the research on AI education was conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods which are useful for future educators and researchers to understand how they assess students’ AI learning performance. We also derive a set of implications for innovative pedagogical designs in terms of educational standards, curriculum designs, formal/informal education, student learning outcomes, teacher professional development and learning progressions to recommend how governments, researchers and educators could build a widely-accepted and age-appropriate AI curriculum for all K-12 learners.},

The state needed a comprehensive curriculum, but how to get the way to artificial intelligence+curriculum is still not discussed in the curriculum. In view of this, this article combines artificial intelligence to promote research on teaching reform, which is aimed at encouraging the implementation of artificial intelligence education and promoting the development of cognitive and pedagogical skills. This object uses the query analysis method to collect the data and analyzes the data based on the distribution technology and the new technological process. It concludes that in life, teachers know more about common artificial intelligence products, such as sound aids , graphics, identity, fingerprint recognition, and smart home. Among teachers using artificial intelligence products, the most frequently used is mobile APP teaching, followed by teachers’ online training platforms. Some teachers use automatic correction assignment systems in teaching, with the help of intelligent classrooms, robotic assistants, and other major future teaching intelligent products. The impact of artificial intelligence on teachers themselves is reducing the teaching workload and improving information literacy. Of course, there are very few teachers who think that artificial intelligence has little or no relationship with teacher professional development. Teachers recognize the role of artificial intelligence. 52.1% of teachers think that artificial intelligence is very helpful to the professional development of teachers. 32.3% of teachers think that artificial intelligence is more helpful to their professional development. 12.5% of teachers recognize artificial intelligence. In general, only 3.1% of teachers believe that artificial intelligence is not helpful to their professional development.},

Chatbots serve as means of learning and teaching, as virtual assistants and social companions. Machine learning algorithms embedded into Chatbots simulate human cognition, including cognitive learning, decision making and adaptation to the environment. Thus, the future of artificial intelligence in Chatbots lies in the development of a global, reliable and sustainable ecosystem of knowledge, skills and values by bringing together all interested stakeholders, such as scientists, consumers, businesses and the state.

 abstract = { Introduction . The urgency of the problem related to personalised learning in future teacher training is associated with the creation of an optimal range of choices in the conditions of intensive development of the informal and non-formal educational environment in the global (interstate) educational space. At the same time, the slogan “teach everyone and everything” is disappearing into the past; instead, the importance of unique specialists, who are able to implement their own pedagogical startups and introduce them into educational practice, is increasing.   Aim. The aim of the article is to describe the development and testing of a structural and functional model of personalised learning in education of future teachers.   Methodology and research methods. The methodological research framework is based on V. A. Petrovsky’s concept of personology, methodology of nonlinear educational systems and transdisciplinary approach in science and education. In the course of the research, the following tools and methods were used: analysis, comparison and generalisation, the authors’ interpretation of psychological and pedagogical literature in the field of accounting for individual characteristics of the student, structural and functional modelling of pedagogical systems. The method of studying the advanced pedagogical experience of Internet education based on the analysis of open online platforms was applied. During the testing of the structural and functional model of personalised education, 178 students (1st–5th year students) were involved in the educational programme “Preschool Education” of full-time and part-time forms of education at Shadrinsk State Pedagogical University. The analysis of students’ diaries and the final questionnaire were employed to determine whether students were satisfied with the personalization in education.   Results. The conceptual and theoretical characteristics of personalised learning are defined: nonlinearity, redundancy, transdisciplinarity, adaptability, openness. The parameters of personalised learning are highlighted: at the level of the subject of social and professional development, the purpose of education, and the content and applied educational technologies. The approbation of the structural and functional model of personalised learning in future teacher training demonstrated a high and average level of satisfaction of students; however, the recorded insufficiency of their own ability to determine the main characteristics of personalized learning was reflected in the quantitative data of satisfaction.   Scientific novelty. In contrast to the existing research in the field of individual approach and personalisation in education, a model of personalised learning in education for future teachers is proposed, which allows them to independently design an individual educational route in the current time and to take into account changing cultural and educational needs in the conditions of the modern global educational space in a broad sense and conditionally divided into interuniversity (international and intra-state interuniversity competitions, forums, conferences, etc.), digital (digital online platforms, electronic educational environments), and professional and personal (participation in individual projects).   Practical significance. According to the intensive development of the global educational space, it is proposed to integrate the available resources to develop personalised learning in future teacher training. },

 abstract = {The framework for data and AI literacy proposed in this contribution aims to create a common understanding of data and AI literacy so that it can be systematically included into curricula and educational standards of schools, teacher training, higher education, and further education. The purpose of the framework is to facilitate the respective set of skills and competencies to be taught as a transdisciplinary competence across all subjects from three perspectives: the application-oriented, the technical-methodological, and the socio-cultural perspective. The framework provides a pathway to establishing basic data literacy for everyone, to enable 21st Century citizens to deal with data and AI in a conscious and ethically sound manner. The framework can also serve as a reference for data and AI literacy programs for extracurricular and vocational training, to enable lifelong learning of data and AI literacy. Therefore, it can be a useful template for public statistical institutions planning to offer data literacy trainings for the public, responding to the challenges resulting from the changing roles and expectations of actors in a data-driven society. A detailed example for such an application, the app “Stadt | Land | Datenfluss”, demonstrates the benefit of the framework for the purpose of adult education.},

 abstract = {In the context of the information age, the development of artificial intelligence is flourishing, and it is becoming more and more closely integrated with economic life, which is an inevitable trend of future social development. Education is also inseparable from the support of science and technology. The penetration of artificial intelligence has changed traditional teaching models and methods. Under the influence of artificial intelligence technology, college education is developing more and more in the direction of informatization and intelligence. For college teachers, the study and application of artificial intelligence is an important and necessary means to achieve professional development. It is more important to train students to take independent self-study exams and focus on applying social skills, so that students can better adapt to the coming era of intelligence. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to explore the development of higher education and the improvement of teaching skills based on artificial intelligence and to analyze the problems and solutions in the process of higher education development. This article will use the research methods of specific problems and specific analysis to compare the data and draw conclusions. The research results show that in the information-based education innovation created by knowledge sharing, the teaching goals and methods are constantly changing. And about 85% of the students believe that the development prospect of intelligent teaching is good, which verifies the feasibility of artificial intelligence technology in the development of college education. Only by training students’ imagination, creativity, critical thinking, and autonomous learning can they adapt to today’s rapidly developing society. Therefore, active learning and research on artificial intelligence is the embodiment of cultivating lifelong learning ability, improving rich teaching skills, constantly summing up experience, actively improving and trimming relevant change programs, and jointly promoting the rapid development of higher education under artificial intelligence.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is presented as an emerging technology that facilitates the personalization of learning and prepares young people for a changing labour market marked by new social requirements This document describes how a virtual training was designed and developed to broaden the knowledge about the A.I. of the 76 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in the subject: “ICT Applied to Education” of the Early Childhood Education’ Degree in the University of Extremadura. Through a mixed research approach, the responses offered by the participants in the questionnaire designed ad hoc for this study and in their own digital portfolio are analyzed. From the Likert scale closed questions were calculated descriptive statistics and for the open questions the technique of qualitative coding analysis was used. The results reveal that students perceive that the A.I. has a positive impact on learning and they are trained to design their own educational resources if they have the support and accompaniment of their university teachers. Finally, we consider that it is necessary to review the curricula of the subjects of the Degree in Early Childhood Education in order to contemplate the use of A.I. in the design of the teaching process of pre-service teacher training.},

 abstract = {The pedagogical strategy of flexible learning itineraries in digital environments aligns with current practices that focus on students’ agency to control their own learning. Flexible learning itineraries allow personalised learning while enhancing self-regulated learning skills such as setting aims and defining strategies. Paramount for successful strategies of flexible learning itineraries is the learning design which has to be defined with precision and responds to a detailed set of needs beyond access at anyplace or anytime. The main aim of flexible learning itineraries is to allow student choice so that they may construct their own pathway by selecting their options based on their own individual needs, motivations and prior knowledge. This research seeks to validate the prototype of a pedagogical strategy based on flexible learning design implemented in a subject of the Teacher Education programme at the University of the Balearic Islands. From a design-based research methodological approach, learning itineraries and sequences were created, and data was collected on student satisfaction via an online survey. Results show, on the one hand, the students' satisfaction with the experience and the pathways built, and on the other hand, in view of the diversity of choices made, that the pathways promoted the personalisation of learning, allowing the teaching-learning process to be adjusted to their personal characteristics. Conclusions suggest that the instructional design supports self-regulated learning strategies. In addition, conclusions reflect on the need to address digital current challenges from equitable and just approaches; and, also, on the value of the teacher's role as designer.},

@article{pub.1147744603,
 abstract = {Abstract   Evidence from various domains underlines the critical role that human factors, and especially trust, play in adopting technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI‐specific misconceptions, myths and fears (e.g., mass unemployment and privacy violations). In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K‐12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K‐12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI‐powered Educational Technology (AI‐EdTech). This paper sheds light on teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech and presents effective professional development strategies to increase teachers' trust and willingness to apply AI‐EdTech in their classrooms. Our experiments with K‐12 science teachers were conducted around their interactions with a specific AI‐powered assessment tool (termed AI‐Grader) using both synthetic and real data. The results indicate that presenting teachers with some explanations of (i) how AI makes decisions, particularly compared to the human experts, and (ii) how AI can complement and give additional strengths to teachers, rather than replacing them, can reduce teachers' concerns and improve their trust in AI‐EdTech. The contribution of this research is threefold. First, it emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI‐EdTech in K‐12 education. Second, it presents a teacher professional development program (PDP), as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it. Third, based on the results observed, it presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming to improve teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech.       Practitioner notes   What is already known about this topic   Human factors, and especially trust, play a critical role in practitioners' adoption of technology.   In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K‐12 education.   Little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K‐12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI‐powered Educational Technology.     What this paper adds   This research emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI‐EdTech in K‐12 education.   It presents a teacher professional development program (PDP) to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech, as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it.   It presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming at improving teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech.     Implications for practice and/or policy   Pre‐ and in‐service teacher education programs that aim to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech should include a section providing teachers with a basic understanding of AI.    PDPs aimed to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech should focus on concrete pedagogical tasks and specific AI‐powered tools that are considered by teachers as helpful and worth the effort to learn.    AI‐EdTech should not restrict teachers to follow specific pedagogical scenarios, but rather provide teachers with the freedom to design and implement various types of pedagogies that meet their preferences, students' needs, and classroom reality.   Teacher agency is key to gaining their trust. AI‐EdTech should allow teachers to review, modify, and if necessary, override AI‐based recommendations before they are sent to students.      },

The proposed framework seeks to support and excite CC students to persist in their STEM education to increase the pipeline for the STEM workforce. Its vision is to provide CC students engineering skills and to excite them about engineering research. The framework enables students to spend 10 summer weeks at Northeastern University to increase skills, confidence, and learn firsthand about research. Each student will join a research lab, working with faculty and graduate student mentors. Also, students will be mentored after summer to further support their successful graduation and/or transfer to a 4-year institution and beyond. The site is guided by two of the grand challenges of the National Academy of Engineering: personalized learning and scientific discovery. Unique aspects of the proposed framework include: a hands-on short course in engineering topics and software tools; formal mentor training including modules for mentoring CC students; daily student meetings with mentors; extensive professional development seminars; formal research training including daily reflection journals, poster presentations and technical writing with a faculty member; and recruitment from a unique pool of highly talented URM students.},

 abstract = {With the continual development of artificial intelligence and smart computing in recent years, quantitative approaches have become increasingly popular as an efficient modeling tool as they do not necessitate complicated mathematical models. Many nations have taken steps, such as transitioning to online schooling, to decrease the harm caused by coronaviruses. Inspired by the demand for technology in early education, the present research uses a radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) modeling technique to predict preschool instructors' technology usage in classes based on recognized determinant characteristics of technology acceptance. In this regard, this study utilized the RBFNN approach to predict preschool teachers' technology acceptance behavior, based on the theory of planned behavior, which states that behavioral achievement, in our case the actual technology use in class, depends on motivation, intention and ability, and behavioral control. Thus, this research design is based on an adapted version of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with eight dimensions: D1. Perceived usefulness, D2. Perceived ease of use, D3. Perceived enjoyment, D4. Intention to use, D5. Actual use, D6. Compatibility, D7. Attitude, and D8. Self-efficacy. According to the TAM, actual usage is significantly predicted by the other seven dimensions used in this research. Instead of using the classical multiple linear regression statistical processing of data, we opted for a NN based on the RBF approach to predict the actual usage behavior. This study included 182 preschool teachers who were randomly chosen from a project-based national preschool teacher training program and who responded to our online questionnaire. After designing the RBF function with the actual usage as an output variable and the other seven dimensions as input variables, in the model summary, we obtained in the training sample a sum of squares error of 37.5 and a percent of incorrect predictions of 43.3%. In the testing sample, we obtained a sum of squares error of 14.88 and a percent of incorrect predictions of 37%. Thus, we can conclude that 63% of the classified data are correctly assigned to the models' dependent variable, i.e., actual technology use, which is a significant rate of correct predictions in the testing sample. This high significant percentage of correct classification represents an important result, mainly because this is the first study to apply RBFNN's prediction on psychological data, opening up a new interdisciplinary field of research.},

Staff should feel confident accessing up-to-date, quality-assured digital health solutions.Digital health is a high priority in government, NHS organisations and Royal Colleges. However, there is a gap between what is expected and the education of staff or medical students to enable implementation.Digital health education needs to be up to date and universally included within training, continuing professional development activities and medical school curriculums.During COVID-19, more families across the UK became digitally enabled with school, council, charities and governments providing access to devices, WiFi and mobile data for those that needed it. Improved digital access brings equalities in access to health information and healthcare professionals. Health app use sharply rose during COVID-19, as patients self-managed and took control of their conditions, but most health apps do not reach NHS standards.Paediatricians are well positioned to advise on appropriate health app use and advocate for improved patient access to solutions.Many paediatricians adopted remote video consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic but could soon adopt more digital health strategies to remotely track, monitor and manage conditions remotely.Patient management now includes remote consultations and digital health solutions; therefore, medical histories should capture digital access, environments and literacy.This article explains the importance of digital health education, lists accessible resources and provides examples of health apps that can be recommended.},

 abstract = {Schools are searching for strategies to foster 4C competencies (Creativity, Cooperation, Communication and Critical Thinking) in children. Scientific Reasoning, Critical Thinking, and the ability to debunk myths are already important competencies that can be fostered with science education. How can we approach the majority of seventh grade students in a given school to create innovative approaches for the future, and leverage their skills in science, art and (digital) technology along the path? And are the teachers ready to guide them on this path? This article focuses on the questions: how did the teachers adopt both the STEAM approach, and the use of digital tools while being supervised by researchers and student teachers and how did this change their beliefs about technology in education. As a pathway, we aimed to connect Robotics, Coding, Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. To end poverty, protect the environment, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030, the SDGs are incorporated into national policies and school curricula. With this, citizens, teachers, and governments alike struggle with strategies on how these goals can be reached by 2030, facing the growing challenges in an ever increasingly complex and insecure world. It is clear that technology will take a dominant role in this development. Based on the STEAM paradigm and the 5E approach of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), we have developed a pedagogical concept that encompasses both the technological aspects, AI and the SDGs. We tested this concept as part of an on-the-job teacher training project with 60 education science student teachers and 8 teachers in their classrooms, together with their 116 7th grade students and found out that STEAM-based projects with a sixth phase in addition to the 5E approach can be carried out promisingly with the help of digital creativity tools. We found that the 5E model with an additional sixth phase is well suited for bringing STEAM into the classroom.},

There are considerable barriers to overcome, including the existing practices of technology education and teachers’ knowledge of AI. Research evidence shows that studying teachers’ experiences can be beneficial in informing how appropriate design in teaching sustainable AI should evolve. Design frames characterize teachers’ design reasoning and can substantially influence their AI lesson design considerations. This study examined 18 experienced teachers’ perceptions of teaching AI and identified effective designs to support AI instruction. Data collection methods involved semi-structured interviews, action study, classroom observation, and post-lesson discussions with the purpose of analyzing the teachers’ perceptions of teaching AI. Grounded theory was employed to detail how teachers understand the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI and the emerging pedagogical solutions from their perspectives. Results reveal that effective AI instructional design should encompass five important components: (1) obstacles to and facilitators of participation in teaching AI, (2) interactive design thinking processes, (3) teachers’ knowledge of teaching AI, (4) orienteering AI knowledge for social good, and (5) the holistic understanding of teaching AI. The implications for future teacher AI professional development activities are proposed.},

 abstract = {As AI becomes more widely used across a variety of disciplines, it is increasingly important to teach AI concepts to K-12 students in order to prepare them for an AI-driven future workforce. Hence, educators and researchers have been working to develop curricula that make these concepts accessible to K-12 students. We are designing and developing a comprehensive AI curriculum delivered through a series of carefully crafted activities in an adapted \emph{Snap!} environment for middle-grade students. In this work, we lay out the proposed content of our curriculum and present the design, development, and implementation results of the first unit of our curriculum that focuses on teaching the breadth-first search algorithm. The activities in this unit have been revised after being piloted with a single high-school student. These activities were further refined after a group of K-12 teachers examined and critiqued them during a two-week professional development workshop. Our teachers created a lesson plan around the activities and implemented that lesson in a summer workshop with 14 middle school students. Our results demonstrated that our activities were successful in helping many of the students in understanding and implementing the algorithm through block-based programming while extra supplementary material was needed to assist some other students. In this paper, we explain our curriculum and technology, the results of implementing the first unit of our curriculum in a summer camp, and lessons learned for future developments.},

 abstract = {Historically, female students have shown low interest in the field of computer science. Previous computer science curricula have failed to address the lack of female-centered computer science activities, such as socially relevant and real-life applications. Our new summer camp curriculum introduces the topics of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and other real-world subjects to engage high school girls in computing by connecting lessons to relevant and cutting edge technologies. Topics range from social media bots, sentiment of natural language in different media, and the role of AI in criminal justice, and focus on programming activities in the NetsBlox and Python programming languages. Summer camp teachers were prepared in a week-long pedagogy and peer-teaching centered professional development program where they concurrently learned and practiced teaching the curriculum to one another. Then, pairs of teachers led students in learning through hands-on AI and ML activities in a half-day, two-week summer camp. In this paper, we discuss the curriculum development and implementation, as well as survey feedback from both teachers and students.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) education for K-12 students is an emerging necessity, owing to the rapid advancement and deployment of AI technologies. It is essential to take teachers’ perspectives into account when creating ecologically valid AI education programmes for K-12 settings. However, very few studies investigated teacher perception of AI education. Phenomenography is an empirical research method that was widely used to understand teacher’s interpretive understanding of new phenomenon, in this study, the teaching of AI in secondary school. Therefore, the present study investigated teachers’ conceptions of teaching AI using a phenomenographic approach. Twenty-eight in-service teachers from 17 secondary schools in Hong Kong were invited to participate in an interview after implementing an AI curriculum. Six categories of teacher conceptions were identified: (1) technology bridging, (2) knowledge delivery, (3) interest stimulation, (4) ethics establishment, (5) capability cultivation, and (6) intellectual development. The hierarchical relationships of the six concepts were organised as an outcome space. The space shows a range of surface to deep conceptions and offers an understanding of how teachers perceive AI education through their teaching experience. Two learning paths have been suggested for cultivating technical and non-technical teachers for teaching AI. These learning paths provide insights for teacher educators and policymakers to enhance teachers’ competence in teaching AI and promote general AI education for K-12 students.},

Therefore, in order to improve the teaching level of Chinese colleges and improve the knowledge reserve of college students, we should spare no effort to develop and improve the professional level of each teacher. The research on teacher training mode based on the development of teachers’ teaching ability is of great significance to the development of colleges and the improvement of teaching quality. The new generation of artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in the training of college teachers. This paper randomly selects 897 undergraduate teachers from 10 private colleges in a certain region of China who participate in higher teacher training for research. It mainly studies the application effect of several typical artificial intelligence technologies in evaluating higher teacher education and training. Specifically, the paper uses artificial intelligence as a carrier to predict the performance indicators of the three main modules involved in higher teacher education and training. The prediction results of several artificial intelligence techniques show that the support vector machine method based on immune algorithm optimization corresponds to the largest coefficient of determination and the smallest root mean square error. Therefore, it predicts the best. Furthermore, the comparison results between the predicted data and the measured data show that the artificial intelligence technology has a better prediction effect on the three module indicators. At the same time, there is a good exponential function relationship between the prediction data corresponding to the two main modules of organization and personnel.},

 abstract = {Online teaching is carried out nationwide in the context of the new crown epidemic prevention and control, and physical education, as one of the compulsory courses in schools and universities, is included within the content of online line lessons. Online physical education teaching is a new approach and attempt to switch from an auxiliary teaching tool to the main teaching tool. The subject matter, target audience, teaching methods, and content of physical education classes have changed dramatically. The development of online physical education has played an important role in popularizing the concept of "sports for life" and establishing the concept of lifelong exercise. Through the analysis and research on the characteristics of online physical education, we propose the measures to promote the overall online teaching ability and level of physical education teachers in the postepidemic period, gradually promote the reform of online and offline physical education, and promote the integration of school physical education and social sports, as well as to build a physical education teacher training system that integrates online and offline development and improve and strengthen the management of Internet physical education resources. Since the teaching effect of online teaching is limited by the teaching means and content, which leads to the low accuracy of the evaluation of online sports teaching effect, for this reason, this paper designs a model based on big data technology and artificial intelligence algorithm for enhancing closed home sports teaching, obtains the overall situation of online physical education by using convolutional neural network to process physical education video sequences, and improves the system performance by embedding the algorithm into the big data framework, to avoid the interference of teaching environment and complete the evaluation of high precision online sports teaching effect. The experimental results show that the proposed method evaluation can improve the computing rate based on ensuring the high accuracy evaluation of physical education online teaching effect.},

 abstract = {While technology advancement and scientific innovation have created new topics and fields of inquiry in STEM education, external content experts such as university scientists/researchers have been increasingly involved to enhance K-12 teachers’ disciplinary understandings and professional development (PD). However, few studies have scrutinized scientist-facilitated PD programs regarding teacher epistemology, about how and in what ways the programs impact teachers’ epistemological understandings of disciplinary knowledge. To address the gap, this paper investigates the process by which teachers construct epistemological understandings and teaching practices in interacting with scientists. Informed by theories of epistemic cognition and social cognition, we conducted an interactional ethnography in a school-university partnered PD program with six primary teachers. Based on participant observation, teacher interviews, and classroom videos and artifacts, we identified three patterns of teacher-scientist negotiation: reciprocal negotiation of knowledge presentation, observation and interpretation of scientist practices, and inconsistency in knowledge translation. The teachers’ professional responsibility and knowledge served as a critical filter in their decisions of selecting, interpreting, and rejecting scientist inputs, leading to respective epistemological stances and pedagogical actions. The research uncovers the situated and multifaceted negotiation of teacher epistemology and offers implications for researching and supporting their epistemological development.},

Participants included teacher educators from three different public teacher education institutions, and staff members of a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) that trains teachers and student teachers in the use of digital education technology. Data were generated through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The findings showed prominence of the media view of instructional technology, especially digital technologies. These conceptualisations appear to be shaped by the teacher educators’ prior training, experience in teaching an instructional technology course, and organisational structures that facilitate the use of instructional technology at the institutions under study. These findings might be useful for teacher educators’ technology professional development content and activities. The findings can also provide insights into extending conversations on the applicability of Teacher Educator Technology Competencies (TETCs) in contexts beyond the USA, where they were primarily developed.},

It was designed not only to reach archivists and academic library staff at every career stage, but also to encourage them to participate in the program as both mentors and mentees in order to share their unique interests. For example, many new professionals are entering the workforce with coveted skills in information and education technology. While they may benefit from being mentored by their more experienced colleagues, they may also participate in the program as mentors so that others may benefit from their skills and knowledge. The holistic, or whole person approach to the design of the program offers mentoring on a range of topics that move beyond professional development and the promotion and tenure process, into issues of personal development and work-life balance. This paper describes, in detail, the mentoring program that was developed in less than one year by an ad hoc committee with administrative support. It includes the steps required to participate in the program as a mentee or mentor, training materials, and lessons learned. Grounded in best practices, the design is flexible and sustainable and is transferable to other environments for those that are considering or rethinking mentoring at their own libraries.},

Bloom's Digital Taxonomy highly contributes to the change that education witnesses today. Students acquire knowledge and skills in various ways and at different speeds, and the idea of giving a personalized learning experience for students in a digital classroom is challenging. From the interviews and observations conducted, participants revealed that acceptance and self-initiated learning served as the key to adapting to technology and learning tools as anchored in Bloom’s Digital Taxonomy for the sudden paradigm shift in education. Participants considered technical aspects, digital literary skills, monitoring, and interaction as challenges to overcome and should be a part of the virtual preparedness. Moreover, teachers positively embrace and maximize the use of technology in education. BDT keeps them on track in aligning learning objectives in differentiated instruction attainable in a virtual set-up. The use of Digital tools as anchored in BDT boosts engagement and motivation, builds closer imitation of face-to-face classes, and enhances education delivery and management in a virtual environment. The researcher recommends that teachers undergo professional development focusing on BDT in differentiated instruction teaching English subjects. The education may use the MDT-EDP Training plan of this study and may conduct a needs analysis to provide the most relevant training for the educators based on their skills, needs, and interest.},

Rapid breakthroughs in information and communication technologies have created new potential in information delivering technologies and have provided new systems in distance learning. In addition, the actualization of high quality and efficiency distance learning programs is essential in achieving a rational allocation of resources, both human and material, as well as upgrading the provided educational work. A key factor in the corresponding training programs is the enrichment of the participants’ professional knowledge, the supply in new methods and practices and the opportunity for self-development, through the satisfaction of personal needs and interests. The key aim of the present article is to explore the views and experiences of education managerial executives regarding the factors of efficient planning, organizing and conducting distance learning. Achieving the abovementioned target is based both in bibliographic references as well as empirical research data, conducted throughout the second semester of the 2013-2014 school year among 37 head teachers. The study concludes that the most significant requirements/factors are the need for developing blended learning programs, based on the combination of conventional and distance learning methods, the constant support from an educationalist, the creation of educational material suitable for personalized learning and the enrichment of the provided training by utilizing the Internet’s capabilities and implementing a variety of educational techniques, such as “face to face” training. In summary, important conclusions are reached in terms of making planning, organizing and conducting distance learning programs more effective.},

The proliferation of smart devices and 5G telecommunications systems are contributing to the development of digital learning systems as an alternative to traditional learning systems. Digital learning includes blended learning, online learning, and personalized learning which mainly depends on the use of new technologies and strategies, so digital learning is widely developed to improve education and combat emerging disasters such as COVID-19 diseases. Despite the tremendous benefits of digital learning, there are many obstacles related to the lack of digitized curriculum and collaboration between teachers and students. Therefore, many attempts have been made to improve the learning outcomes through the following strategies: collaboration, teacher convenience, personalized learning, cost and time savings through professional development, and modeling. In this study, facial expressions and heart rate are used to measure the effectiveness of digital learning systems and the level of learners' engagement in learning environments. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the known related works in terms of learning effectiveness. The results of this research can be used to develop a digital learning environment.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools in the care of individual patients and patient populations is rapidly expanding.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to systematically identify research on provider competencies needed for the use of AI in clinical settings.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to identify articles published between January 1, 2009, and May 1, 2020, from MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases, using search queries for terms related to health care professionals (eg, medical, nursing, and pharmacy) and their professional development in all phases of clinical education, AI-based tools in all settings of clinical practice, and professional education domains of competencies and performance. Limits were provided for English language, studies on humans with abstracts, and settings in the United States.
RESULTS: The searches identified 3476 records, of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. These studies described the use of AI in clinical practice and measured at least one aspect of clinician competence. While many studies measured the performance of the AI-based tool, only 4 measured clinician performance in terms of the knowledge, skills, or attitudes needed to understand and effectively use the new tools being tested. These 4 articles primarily focused on the ability of AI to enhance patient care and clinical decision-making by improving information flow and display, specifically for physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: While many research studies were identified that investigate the potential effectiveness of using AI technologies in health care, very few address specific competencies that are needed by clinicians to use them effectively. This highlights a critical gap.},

 abstract = {In this research, a model to determine chemistry teachers’ acceptance of educational software in secondary education is proposed. The model extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. Data were collected from 556 Czech chemistry teachers and analysed using structural equation modelling. With respect to the significant differences among technology users and various types of nonusers, the research model for each user group was tested too. The results showed significant differences in the individual models for each group of technology user. In the model for ‘current users’ of educational software, the influence of facilitating conditions on current users’ use of educational software behavioural intention is stressed. In addition, non-planning users’ behavioural intention seems to be influenced by their personal innovativeness in IT, social influence, and performance expectancy. Behavioural intention and attitude towards using educational software affect each of the tested models, with attitudes being an even stronger predictor of educational software usage than behavioural intention. The models contribute to the understanding of teachers’ acceptance of educational software, which can be utilized in both pre- and in-service teacher training, considering technology mastery a necessary teacher competence. Keywords: chemistry teachers’ motivation, educational software use, secondary education, technology acceptance},

 abstract = {The increasing attention to Machine Learning (ML) in K-12 levels and studies exploring a different aspect of research on K-12 ML has necessitated the need to synthesize this existing research. This study systematically reviewed how research on ML teaching and learning in K-12 has fared, including the current area of focus, and the gaps that need to be addressed in the literature in future studies. We reviewed 43 conference and journal articles to analyze specific focus areas of ML learning and teaching in K-12 from four perspectives as derived from the data: curriculum development, technology development, pedagogical development, and teacher training/professional development. The findings of our study reveal that (a) additional ML resources are needed for kindergarten to middle school and informal settings, (b) further studies need to be conducted on how ML can be integrated into subject domains other than computing, (c) most of the studies focus on pedagogical development with a dearth of teacher professional development programs, and (d) more evidence of societal and ethical implications of ML should be considered in future research. While this study recognizes the present gaps and direction for future research, these findings provide insight for educators, practitioners, instructional designers, and researchers into K-12 ML research trends to advance the quality of the emerging field.},

 abstract = {As smart technology promotes the development of various industries, artificial intelligence (AI) has also become an important driving force for innovation and transformation in education. For teachers, how to skillfully apply AI in teaching and improve their AI literacy has become a necessary goal for their sustainable professional development. This research examines the correlations among the dimensions of AI literacy of teachers in order to promote the effectiveness of class teaching and the adoption of artificial intelligence literacy (AIL). Our findings are based on the analysis of 1013 survey results, where we tested the level of AI literacy of teachers, including Knowing and Understanding AI (KUAI), Applying AI (AAI), Evaluating AI Application (EAIA), and AI Ethics (AIE). We find that AAI had a significant, positive effect on the other three dimensions. Thus, based on the analysis, the government should take action to cultivate teachers’ AI literacy. In order to improve teachers’ AI literacy, the choice of curriculum, content, methods, and practical resources for special training should be diverse and committed to making AI literacy an essential enabler for teachers’ sustainable future development.},

Longitudinal questionnaire data from 188 teachers in 42 primary and secondary schools were analyzed using scale and correlation analysis methods and auto-regressive models. For each of the three consecutive years of the study, teachers rated themselves as having high self-efficacy in the development of a personalized learning environment. Their high self-efficacy was attributed to personal factors (enthusiasm, identification with the school) rather than subjective perceptions of contextual factors (collective self-efficacy, school climate, innovation climate). It had a positive relationship with retrospectively reported improvements in teaching and learning. The results show that the role teachers’ self-efficacy plays in the development of a personalized learning environment should not be underestimated. It should therefore be examined more closely by empirical studies and given weight in teacher training programs/development.},

 abstract = {A daily use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a fact in many fields today, and two of them are psychology and social work. At the same time as AI systems are used for predicting psychological treatments and for decisions in social welfare, higher education has few AI courses for these professions. Moreover, there are several examples in these fields where AI can make unethical decisions that need to be corrected by humans. To better understand the possibilities and challenges of AI in psychology and social work, professional users of AI services need a tailored education on how the underlying technology works. The aim of this paper is to present a project concept for the design and evaluation of a novel course in AI for professional development in psychology and social work. For the design and development of the course the guiding research question should be: What are the strengths and challenges with contemporary AI techniques regarding prediction, adaptivity and decision systems? The suggested AI course should be given as a technology enhanced online training to enable the idea of anytime and anywhere for full-time working participants. Course content and activities are divided into the four separate sections of: 1) The history of AI structured around the 'Three waves of AI', with o focus on the current third wave. 2) A section with a focus on AI techniques for prediction and adaptivity. Underlying techniques such as machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning will be conceptually described and discussed, but not on a detailed level. 3) An elaborated discussion on the relevance, usefulness and trust, and the at the difference between AI-based decision systems and AI-based decision support systems. 4) Finally, the fourth section should comprise the ethical aspects of AI, and discuss transparency and Explainable AI. An innovative approach of the project is to use a neuroscientific assessment of the education to understand how the education changes brain function relevant to evaluate AI based decision. This should be complemented with a qualitative evaluation based on semi-structured interviews.},

Islamic teachings regard the pursuit of individual growth through education as a sacred and lifelong task. As a form of continuous development, efforts to increase knowledge, wisdom, and skills are considered as an obligation of a Muslim. Finally, the development of technology and the progress of thinking in an Islamic perspective must be in line. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of learning technology in the professional development of Islamic religious education in Indonesia. In the current bibliometric analysis study, we used SCOPUS as a database or information which was further analyzed according to the flow and several screening processes according to the objectives of this study. The bibliometric analysis was carried out on April 26, 2022 by exploring the SCOPUS database, and in the 'search documents' entering keywords or keywords for the study title in the English version so that SCOPUS could read and crawl it adequately. Keyword inserted TITLE-ABS-KEY (learning AND technology AND in AND on AND Islamic AND education). This is an initial screening process, which is not limited to year, subject area, document type and source, and other types of restrictions. At this stage, as many as 170 documents were found in the range from 1994 to 2022 (no data or documents were found before 1994 with keywords inserted). The second screening was scanned with the same keywords as the first screening and added with the keyword 'Indonesia' in the 'search documents' menu. conference paper' on all subject areas. The results found as many as 24 documents in the span of that year. Finally, the results of this study can be a reference and preference for the study of the development of Islamic religious learning, especially for scholars engaged in Islamic education technology in all fields of science.},

 abstract = {Existing Predictive Learning Analytics (PLA) systems utilising machine learning models show they can improve teacher practice and, at the same time, student outcomes. The accuracy, and related errors, of these systems can negatively influence their adoption. However, little effort has been made to investigate the errors made by the underlying models. This study focused on errors of models predicting students at risk of not submitting their assignments. We analysed two groups of error when the model was confident about the prediction: (a) students predicted to submit their assignment, yet they did not (False Negative; FN), and (b) students predicted not to submit their assignment yet they did (False Positive; FP). We followed the principles of thematic analysis to analyse interview data from 27 students whose predictions presented FN or FP errors. Findings revealed the significance of unexpected events occurring during studies that can affect students' behaviour and cannot be foreseen and accounted for in PLA, such as changes in family and work responsibilities, unexpected health issues and computer problems. Interview data helped identify new data sources, which could be integrated into predictions to mitigate some of the errors, such as study loan application information. Some other sources, e.g. capturing student knowledge at the start of the course, would require changes in the learning design of courses. Our insights showcase the importance of complimenting AI-based systems with human intelligence. In our case, these were both the interviewed students providing insights, as well potential users of these systems, e.g. teachers, who are aware of contextual factors, invisible to ML algorithms. We discuss the implications for improving predictions, learning design and teacher training in using PLA in their practice.},

 abstract = {Healthcare management continues to worsen, with process inefficiencies, wastage, unsafe practices and accordingly, non-optimal patient care. The concept of the Learning Health Systems (LHS) demonstrates the potential for the utilisation of  health data in real time, through rapid and continuous cycles of data interrogation, implementation of insights into practice, and eventually practice change (Friedman & Flynn, 2019). Yet, the lack of appropriately skilled workforce results in an inability to leverage existing data to design innovative solutions. We identified a need to develop tailored professional development programs to foster skilled interdisciplinary learning communities in the healthcare workforce, as well as digital health champions that understand each other’s roles and capabilities, to collaboratively solve these complex problems. Thus, we have developed multiple educational programs of work, including a professional development short course and a year-long Academy Fellowship program, to teach LHS principles.
The short course is wholly online, open to interdisciplinary professionals working in the digital health arena. To foster interprofessional learning, we assigned participants into working groups of five interprofessional members, who worked together and shared knowledge, perspectives and experiences in workshop activities throughout the 13-week course. We employed a flipped classroom approach, utilising various eLearning tools such as crowdsourced evidence synthesis Mind Maps; Jupyter Notebooks for hands on data interrogation, data visualisation and interpretation of machine learning models; clinical process modelling software (LucidChart); and virtual care platform for prototype testing digital health solutions (Datos), which showcasing the potential of technology.
We undertook a mixed methods evaluation, to determine the utility and success of our programming. This framework consisted of pre and post-surveys with identical measures of self-efficacy, ratings scales for engagement, usefulness, applicability and value for various aspects of the course. Participants were also invited to participate in a semi-structured interview post course. This allowed a deeper dive into themes relating to utility, barriers, recommendations for future applicability, and evolving digital health identity.
The evaluation results demonstrated that participants found the teaching model useful, engaging, applicable and valuable to their daily tasks and workplace LHS projects. Self-efficacy scales revealed a significant increase in perceive confidence. From interviews and analysis of free text responses, we discovered that the program gave participants a shared language and common understanding to converse with other interprofessional peers; transformed their perceptions of their role and the potential of data and technologies; provided a framework to organise their transformation plans; and finally provided a toolkit to refer to and operate from. The most notable observation from the LHS Academy Fellows, was a significant increase in the number of fellows identifying themselves as leaders at the end of their foundational coursework compared to at the start of the program.
It is clear that in order to transform healthcare systems to their full potential, it requires a workforce with an understanding of LHS and the potential of data driven approaches, as well as an appreciation for the need for diversly skilled learning communities to tackle these problems together.},

 abstract = {The concept of self-directedness is a missing link in South African science classrooms, and as a result, science teachers are often not self-directed in employing innovative teaching and learning strategies such as blended problem-based learning (BPBL) that might enhance self-directed learning. Literature is replete with studies showing that science teachers in the United States, Indonesia, and South Africa, to name a few, lack the necessary technological skills to utilise simulations in the teaching and learning of Physical Sciences. This intervention-based explanatory mixed methods study was conducted in one of the nine education provinces of South Africa. Quantitative data were generated using a self-directed learning instrument (SDLI), the Physics Education Technology interactive simulations questionnaire, and a PBL questionnaire. Forty participants were sampled using both cluster and systematic random sampling techniques. Qualitative data were generated through a BPBL scenario, a reflective portfolio, and semi-structured interviews with two purposively selected participants. The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and parametric statistics. The reflective portfolio was analysed using a performance standards scoring rubric adopted from Smith et al. (2001). The BPBL Scenario Evaluation Schedule and interviews were analysed using Saldaña’s (2013) code-to-theory analytical model. It was concluded that there was a significant difference in participants’ perceptions of PBL, self-directedness, and interactive simulations after attending a teacher professional development intervention (TPDI) and implementing BPBL. The findings show that the utilisation of interactive simulations and PBL in Physical Sciences classrooms were unknown to teachers – suggesting that teachers were not self-directed in implementing BPBL. This study presents a model for designing BPBL activities and an evaluation schedule for assessing those activities for self-directedness in educational practices.},

Training in-service teachers to incorporate and utilize technology as part of Internet-based instructions was a challenge and pressing necessity. TPACK is an essential framework for comprehending how teachers employ technology in teaching. Despite the significance of adaptive learning environments in recent years, research has not addressed how to use these environments to improve the TPACK of in-service teachers, particularly during crises. Consequently, our objective was to design an adaptive learning environment that provides in-service math, science, and English teachers with substantial and continuing support for each TPACK component. A total of 173 in-service teachers were divided into two groups: an experimental group of 83 who used adaptive learning and a control group of 90 who used Zoom techniques. TPACK questionnaires were administered before and after the experiment. The experimental group improved TPACK more than the control group. All teachers believed that adaptive learning training helped them to build technology-integrated lesson plans. This study provides ideas and practices for developing an adaptive learning environment for the in-service teachers' TPACK development. The challenges to adaptive learning environments have been highlighted, identifying the potential for future investigations.},

 abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has transformed the delivery of nursing education. This scoping review identified innovative improvements or changes in nursing education developed by nursing faculty in response to the COVID-19 pandemic globally. This is a scoping review using Arksey and O’Malley framework, refined by Joanna Briggs Institute. Three electronic databases were searched to identify studies published between December 2019 and December 2021, irrespective of design. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Statement for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the studies, and multiple reviewers extracted the studies. Two reviewers crosschecked 10% of the extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency. We grouped and described conceptual categories narratively. Of the 1339 retrieved papers, 111 met eligibility criteria. Most studies were from North America (69; 62.2%) and involved undergraduate nursing students (80; 72.1%). Many studies (61; 55.0%) were letters, commentaries, and editorials that offered short communications on ongoing innovative interventions. Reported nursing education innovations included online or virtual alternatives to face-to-face delivery (68; 61.3%), online or virtual alternatives to clinical placement (39; 35.1%) and faculty development (4; 3.4%). Reported outcomes included students’ satisfaction and intervention experiences. The reported innovations were crucial in mitigating the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic for nursing education. Nurse educators are presented with a unique opportunity to embrace and build on the emerging pedagogies even after the global emergency. Further research must focus on 1) understanding the sustainability and enduring effects of the identified innovations in the post-pandemic period; 2) supporting students and faculty with new learning platforms, and 3) the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education.

 abstract = {One example of the digitalization of education is the creation of a linguistic learner corpus of student papers in a foreign language at an educational institution in order to use this corpus for research, teaching and learner analytics. This paper describes the experience of creating such linguistic learner corpus at Petrozavodsk State University. Petrozavodsk Annotated Corpus of Texts (PACT) was founded in 2020, but even 2 years of its development have already shown a wide field for implementing this experience in the work of a university. The article provides a general description of the learner corpus PACT and gives examples of its use – being implemented and planned to be implemented. The key research question is what opportunities for training and professional development of future foreign language teachers offers and what potential for educational data mining and management of the educational process the learner corpus in a foreign language has. Answering this basic question, the authors refer to the experience of another corpus of student texts — REALEC, the English annotated learner corpus, which is the prototype of the original PACT corpus. The authors conclude that the corpus of student texts in a foreign language, as an example of big data collected in a university, has great potential in several directions: for research purposes for specialists in linguistics, linguodidactics, psycholinguistics, information technology and artificial intelligence; for educational purposes directly applied in the foreign language classes, for students research work and as a resource for individual tasks automatic generator; for educational data mining.},

In this study, the self-reported changes in culturally-responsive teaching perceptions of ten classroom teachers serving more than six hundred students are reported. This paper includes first year findings from a program designed to use artificial-intelligence (AI) based algorithms to reduce implicit bias in teaching. Findings from this study include significant pre-post increases for self-efficacy related to culturally responsive teaching as well as instructional self-efficacy. These findings add credibility to the contention that a key innovation of using simulation programs for teacher professional development is that it provides teachers and teacher trainees many learning trials with simulated students, thereby increasing teacher confidence and competence, and which in turn will improve student learning. Findings set the stage for measuring the impact on student perceptions of learning and cultural engagement intended to support teachers in recognizing and ameliorating their own implicit biases.},

 abstract = {Significant language development differences occur in preschoolers, resolving these differences is a key objective of preschool education because young children's language abilities at the start of school, particularly their vocabulary abilities, are a strong predictor of later academic ability. Storytelling is one of the methods used to teach English, it makes the learning environment more interesting, energetic, and conversational. This study aims to examine storytelling in increasing children's vocabulary. The research method is a case study that uses observation, interviews, and documentation as data collection tools. The participants are an English teacher and seven children aged 4-5 years. Although, many early childhoods English teachers state that one of the weaknesses of children in learning English is a lack of vocabulary mastery because it can hamper the learning process. The findings show that storytelling is effective in increasing children's vocabulary. Vocabulary is the foundation for improving children's ability to speak English, both orally and in writing. Second language vocabulary is important to learn and develop for the quality of early childhood learners in language education.

Авторами исследуются возможности современных сквозных технологий в начальном образовании, в частности анализируется практика реализации сервисов, основанных на нейронных сетях, которые позволяют сделать анализ и оценку учебного процесса более независимым и объективным. Описывается практический опыт реализации сервисов компьютерного зрения, генерации и анализа изображений; включения в учебный процесс иммерсивных средств чтения, создания и применения различных моделей классификации текстов. Эти методы позволяют автоматизировать некоторые рутинные профессиональные функции учителя и сделать учебный процесс более насыщенным, современным и увлекательным как для самого педагога, так и для обучающихся. Акцентируется внимание на использовании возможностей искусственного интеллекта в качестве не только средства обучения, но и оценивания знаний, умений, навыков, а также развития личностных качеств детей. Развитие отечественного программного обеспечения и переход на программные продукты в школе определяют направления дальнейших исследований, одним из которых является разработка авторских программ учебной дисциплины «Сквозные технологии и искусственный интеллект» для педагогических направлений обучения в вузах. The article treats a relevant issue of using artificial intelligence, neural networks and other cross-cutting technologies. The authors of the article investigate the potential of using modern cross-cutting technologies in primary classrooms. They treat the potential of using neural networks to ensure greater independence and objectivity of the analysis and assessment of the learning process. The article describes an experience of implementing services which rely on computer vision, image generation, image processing, immersive reading, text classification. These methods enable one to automate some routine tasks performed by teachers and enrich the learning process by making it more modern, creative and interesting for teachers and students. The authors maintain that artificial intelligence can be used as a learning tool, as a means to assess students’ knowledge and skills and as a means to develop students’ personal qualities. The prospects of further research are connected with the development of Russian software and the use of Russian software in schools, namely with the development of the “Cross-cutting Technologies and Artificial Intelligence” course that can be used in novice teachers’ training.},

 abstract = {Abstract   The anthropomorphic characteristics of artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a positive environment for self‐regulated learning (SRL). The factors affecting adolescents' SRL through AI technologies remain unclear. Limited AI and disciplinary knowledge may affect the students' motivations, as explained by self‐determination theory (SDT). In this study, we examine the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in SDT on the relationship between students' previous technical (AI) and disciplinary (English) knowledge and SRL, using an AI conversational chatbot. Data were collected from 323 9th Grade students through a questionnaire and a test. The students completed an AI basic unit and then learned English with a conversational chatbot for 5 days. Confidence intervals were calculated to investigate the mediating effects. We found that students' previous knowledge of English but not their AI knowledge directly affected their SRL with the chatbot, and that satisfying the need for autonomy and competence mediated the relationships between both knowledge (AI and English) and SRL, but relatedness did not. The self‐directed nature of SRL requires heavy cognitive learning and satisfying the need for autonomy and competence may more effectively engage young children in this type of learning. The findings also revealed that current chatbot technologies may not benefit students with relatively lower levels of English proficiency. We suggest that teachers can use conversational chatbots for knowledge consolidation purposes, but not in SRL explorations.       Practitioner notes   What is already known about this topic   Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can potentially support students' self‐regulated learning (SRL) of disciplinary knowledge through chatbots.   Needs satisfaction in Self‐determination theory (SDT) can explain the directive process required for SRL.   Technical and disciplinary knowledge would affect SRL with technologies.     What this paper adds   This study examines the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in SDT on the relationship between students' previous AI (technical) and English (disciplinary) knowledge and SRL, using an AI conversational chatbot.   Students' previous knowledge of English but not their AI knowledge directly affected their SRL with the chatbot.   Autonomy and competence were mediators, but relatedness was not.     Implications for practice and/or policy   Teachers should use chatbots for knowledge consolidation rather than exploration.   Teachers should support students' competence and autonomy, as these were found to be the factors that directly predicted SRL.   School leaders and teacher educators should include the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in professional development programmes for digital education.      },

 abstract = {PURPOSE: The expanded use of clinical tools that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) methods has generated calls for specific competencies for effective and ethical use. This qualitative study used expert interviews to define AI-related clinical competencies for health care professionals.
METHOD: In 2021, a multidisciplinary team interviewed 15 experts in the use of AI-based tools in health care settings about the clinical competencies health care professionals need to work effectively with such tools. Transcripts of the semistructured interviews were coded and thematically analyzed. Draft competency statements were developed and provided to the experts for feedback. The competencies were finalized using a consensus process across the research team.
RESULTS: Six competency domain statements and 25 subcompetencies were formulated from the thematic analysis. The competency domain statements are: (1) basic knowledge of AI: explain what AI is and describe its health care applications; (2) social and ethical implications of AI: explain how social, economic, and political systems influence AI-based tools and how these relationships impact justice, equity, and ethics; (3) AI-enhanced clinical encounters: carry out AI-enhanced clinical encounters that integrate diverse sources of information in creating patient-centered care plans; (4) evidence-based evaluation of AI-based tools: evaluate the quality, accuracy, safety, contextual appropriateness, and biases of AI-based tools and their underlying data sets in providing care to patients and populations; (5) workflow analysis for AI-based tools: analyze and adapt to changes in teams, roles, responsibilities, and workflows resulting from implementation of AI-based tools; and (6) practice-based learning and improvement regarding AI-based tools: participate in continuing professional development and practice-based improvement activities related to use of AI tools in health care.
CONCLUSIONS: The 6 clinical competencies identified can be used to guide future teaching and learning programs to maximize the potential benefits of AI-based tools and diminish potential harms.},

 abstract = {For K-12 teachers to develop effective teaching skills, integration of role modeling strategies into teaching and learning process as a dimension of selfregulated learning is of the foremost value. Role modeling strategy training through a hybrid professional development model bears the potential to serve as a facilitating component in promoting K-12 teachers’ instructional competence. Conducted within the self-regulated learning framework, this study suggested findings of a teacher professional development training aimed at role modeling strategy implementation at K-12 level. Pursuing a mixed-method model, the current research was performed with 16 teachers who were trained and supervised to integrate role-modeling strategies into their teaching context. In this study, the data sources were role-modeling- integrated lesson plans, trainers’ feedback on these lesson plans, and online student products. The data collection methods included lesson plan evaluation through a role-modeling rubric in a quantitative fashion, whereas content analysis of trainer feedback on lesson plans, latterly revised lesson plans and online student products composed the qualitative aspect. Results revealed that this professional development training achieved significantly positive changes in teachers’ role modeling strategy implementation skills, particularly in terms of teachers’ role as agents in students’ self-regulated learning skills, promotion of student-centered learning and overall improvement in students’ self-regulated learning skills. Further, the integration of education technology tools into lessons was observed to have a positive impact on enhancing students’ self-regulated learning skills. This study could offer major contributions to designing teacher professional development training for researchers, practitioners, and teacher trainers, particularly in role modeling dimension of self-regulated learning.},

 abstract = {Creativity is considered one of the skills crucial for 21 Century to face the challenges proposed by the 2030 education agenda (Frey & Osborne 2013; OECD, 2018, Reimers & Chung 2019). In our reading, active methodologies such as project-based learning and design thinking are often seen as fundamental in favoring creativity together oriented towards individual, social, and planetary well-being (UN, 2022). A persistent problem for the training of 21st century skills, in which creativity, intellectual openness and computational thinking are essential in teacher training, is the adherence to cognitivist foundations and conventional methodologies. The traditional cognitivism has reduced the notion of creativity in processes and products. In our proposal, we want to redirect the question about what happens in the head (process) or in the world that makes people creative (world), rather, we invite creativity to be considered as a skillful experience embedded in a context and that arises from sensorimotor engagement and distributed perception (Varela, Thompson & Rosch, 1991; Hutchins 1995; Kalaydjian et al 2022).   In this sense, we propose the 4E cognition approach (embodied, enacted, embedded, and extended) as a necessary theoretical and empirical framework to guide the understanding of creativity in contexts of active methodologies. Project-Based Learning and Design Thinking teacher education often fosters creativity as a deep experience that emerges in engagement with artifacts and interaction with others, opening unprecedented possibilities for capturing emerging understanding and enhancing skillful performance in challenging tasks (Videla, Veloz and Pino, in press). However, active methodologies such as project-based learning and design thinking are hardly linked to contemporary paradigms of cognition that are anti-representationalist, embodied, and situated in sociocultural contexts. The 4E approach argues that cognition is intertwined with the world because of a history of structural couplings, that is, the contingent relationships that stage skillful performance in response to the situational sense of sensorimotor engagement with artifacts and people (Dreyfus, 2002). We assume that creativity is a skillful experience of kinesthetic 'knowledge' (Penny, 2022).   In teacher training, these ideas for cultivating creativity are overshadowed by conventional static methodologies and cognitive notions that reduce creativity to final products and internal mental processes (Guilford 1967; Torrance 1972; Sternberg & Grigorenko 2001; Gardner 1994; Kaufman & Beghetto 2009). Although these notions have contributed to understanding the phenomenon of creativity, in this article we relate to collective, distributed, and embodied notions of creativity that escape individual and cognitive bias (Glăveanu 2014; Ihde & Malafouris 2019; Malinin 2019). Our approach is in tune with Vygotsky's ideas about perceptual ontogenesis, in which perception is reconfigured from naive to cultural forms within dedicated cultural settings designed for exploratory activity (Vygotsky, 1926/2001). Considering the above, we present some didactic experiences through ethnographic participant observation, we observe students of pedagogies engaging in creative activities suggested by our theoretical approach. We use these observations to illustrate how Project-Based Learning and Design Thinking allow us to understand creativity from the point of view of experiential becoming, as argued by Tim Ingold (2014). That is, rethinking the creativity inherent in practice and paying attention to the development of contingent relationships, which emerge learning by doing from designing and prototyping with technologies.

 abstract = {Drawing on a technology dispositions framework, this study examined the changes in teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, competence, and behavioral intentions toward the use of technology in the mathematics classroom, following their engagement in professional development (PD) mediated by GeoGebra software. In a case study research design, 11 mathematics teachers from a senior high school in Ghana were purposively selected to engage in a 1-year PD program. They worked in teams to design and enact GeoGebra-based mathematics lessons. A self-report questionnaire, semi-structured interview, and lesson observation were used for data collection. Self-report data were analyzed using mean, SD, paired sample t-test, and Hedges’ g. Interview and lesson observation data were analyzed using a thematic approach. The results indicated that teachers’ pedagogical beliefs, affective attitudes, and competence toward technology changed following the PD. To some extent, they were able to make the goals of their mathematics lessons explicit and sequenced their instructional activities to engage students’ geometric and algebraic thinking. However, their intention to put the new pedagogy into classroom practice in the future depended on multiple contextual factors: administrative support, continual professional training, and provision of adequate technology facilities. These findings have implications for practices in mathematics education, technology dispositions frameworks, and PD.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates and analyzes the current situation of regional teaching staff and explores the path of AI in enhancing the construction of primary and secondary school teachers. Recent state documents have emphasized the urgent need for AI to improve teaching staff development. The study reveals issues in the construction of primary and secondary school teachers' teams in teaching, management, and training. For instance, classroom teaching is limited by time and space, making it difficult to achieve personalized learning for students and differentiated teaching for teachers. Teacher training lacks individual and group diagnosis, which does not consider teacher individuality, differences, and hierarchy. The evaluation of teachers in regional management and service tends to be subjective, and the awareness and application of data are inadequate. The study proposes addressing these problems by building and applying teacher big data, developing an AI assistant for teachers, and upgrading the quality of teaching intelligent monitoring systems. The proposed measures aim to promote high-quality development of regional teaching staff by establishing the main path for AI to enhance the construction of primary and secondary school teachers.},

 abstract = {The Zhongliang Xiangyun Branch of Chengdu Longjiang Road Primary School, as a relatively young and inexperienced school, faced difficulties in guiding teachers towards suitable paths for their professional growth. To address this challenge and strengthen the teachers’ team, the school leverages its position as a key project school of digital teacher portraits in Wuhou District to conduct research on teachers’ professional growth paths. The study focuses on three directions, including teachers’ intelligent management path, teachers’ personalized research path, and teachers’ intelligent teaching implementation path. The school emphasizes the renewal of teachers’ education concepts and the improvement of their professional level, and develops a “Yunxin” teacher growth path planning map to construct a closed growth path through an all-round portrait of teachers. The school uses the intelligent management platform to realize paperless office work and to file teachers’ personal data and teaching resources online. Through the evaluation system of the digital teacher portrait platform, the school can effectively evaluate teachers’ work and establish a teacher development model. Furthermore, the school integrates both “offline centralized teaching” and “online personalized learning” to incorporate teacher classroom teaching data and student learning effect data into the important indicators of teacher “data portrait”. This integration promotes and supports teachers to carry out differentiated teaching, finally establishing a new model of “student-centered” intelligent education.},

 abstract = {The article substantiates the necessity of implementing the «Industry 5.0» concept. Key aspects of this models are sustainability, sustainable development and people-centeredness. That is, it is important to make decisions that contribute the growth of stability and resistance of production to changes in the operating environment, the growth of the level competitiveness in the long term, taking into account the impact of the digital workforce environment for employee safety, satisfaction with working conditions and work in general, taking into consideration interests of other interested parties, including consumers. Its advantages and effectiveness for domestic business entities, in particular employees, are determined. The main advantages of implementing this concept for employees are the following: 1) changing the role of the employee for the industry; 2) safety and inclusiveness of the work environment; 3) skills, professional development and retraining. It is impossible to ensure the improvement of the qualifications of each individual employee of the industry. By conditions of increasing automation, some skills will become obsolete, it will become unnecessary to develop them. It is important to ensure that every employee has a certain basic level of knowledge and understanding of digital skills, especially this concerns the understanding of artificial intelligence, its potential benefits and limitations. To apply technologies, employees must be involved in the process, trained and motivated. The overall effectiveness of the concept under consideration for the industry as a whole is long-term – constant competitiveness and relevance due to successful adaptation to the changing world and new markets, which can be achieved through: talent attraction and retention, utilization efficiency resources to ensure the appropriate level of sustainability and competitiveness, raising the level stability, that is, the ability to flexibly cope with changes. The conditions for the successful implementation of the concept are outlined, in particular close cooperation between enterprises, educational institutions. Education, personnel training, retraining and advanced training are among most pressing issues that need to be resolved when adapting to the digital transition in industries, because skilled human capital is critical to making this a reality. It is important for society to understand the fact that innovations are not created by the state, the government, but by entrepreneurs and youth and innovative and entrepreneurial universities. At the same time, state and financial institutions should contribute and to help businesses that realize and implement innovations. A model of marketing management of the enterprise was developed in accordance with the concept of «Industry 5.0». It is proposed to base the model on the principles of people-centeredness and digitization of processes management and marketing of business entities.},

 abstract = {This paper aims to improve post-pandemic English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education by leveraging immersive, NLP-driven, AI-based tools that promote collaboration and interactivity in teaching. It is because the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted conventional language education, leading to a shift towards online instruction and requiring new language learning strategies. The study used a mixedmethods approach integrating quantitative and qualitative data collection and processing strategies to examine the effectiveness of collaborative and interactive AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) applications on EFL instruction in a post-pandemic online teaching environment. To collect data, teachers, and students at the University of Abomey-Calavi (UAC) in Benin were surveyed, interviewed, and observed during online language learning sessions. The data was analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The study used questionnaire surveys to analyze the quantitative data and the thematic (content) analysis method to identify significant trends and themes in the qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews and online class observations. The results revealed the advantages and disadvantages of using AI-supported collaborative and interactive language learning in EFL instruction, the learning methodologies and assessment approaches used in AI-supported online collaborative learning, the role of technology in supporting lifelong learning, and the impact of ICT teacher training on the integration of AI-supported online collaborative learning in EFL instruction. The outcomes provide new insights into the impact of AI-assisted collaborative and interactive language learning on EFL instruction and its implications for EFL teachers and students in the post-COVID-19 era.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of the era of artificial intelligence, the application ability of programming is also highlighted. As one of the necessary abilities of social talents in the future, primary and secondary schools pay more and more attention to this, and programming education is also in full swing. Therefore, based on previous studies, this paper further clarifies the current situation when the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools is ambiguous. This paper is aimed at a wide range of primary and secondary school teachers. With 1500 teachers who participated in the online training class for programming teachers as the object in Chinese primary, middle and high school stages, mainly from the three levels of schools, teachers, and students. The questionnaire with good reliability and validity test was used as the research method, the survey data were statistically described and analyzed, and differences were analyzed using Microsoft Excel2019, SPSS26.0 and so on, it investigates and analyzes the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools. Results indicate that the overall quality of programming education offerings in elementary and secondary schools is subpar, and the construction of programming education curriculum in schools requires improvement. Nevertheless, schools prioritize improving students' comprehensive abilities, and teachers hold a positive attitude towards programming education and teaching. Although students demonstrate a strong interest in learning, their foundation is weak, resulting in poor learning outcomes. Consequently, the author provides specific recommendations regarding programming education's working mechanism, curriculum standard system, teacher training, and educational resources sharing to better develop programming education in primary and secondary schools.},

                    The research
                    relevance is due to the need for regional education systems to develop tools and assessment techniques that allow identifying professional deficits in Russian teachers. This article analyses the results of approbation diagnostics of professional competencies of teachers in the state information system “Electronic Education of the Republic of Tatarstan”. Diagnostic tools were developed by scientific and pedagogical workers of organisations of higher and additional professional education of the Republic in accordance with the provisions of the professional standard “Teacher”.
                    Aim
                    . The present research aims to analyse and summarise the results of the monitoring of professional deficits of teachers of the Republic of Tatarstan in the field of subject, methodological, psychological, pedagogical and regulatory competencies for further building individual development trajectories and targeted professional development programmes.
                    Methodology and research methods
                    . Teachers were tested in their personal accounts in the information system “Electronic Education of the Republic of Tatarstan”. Evaluation materials were divided into blocks that differ in content and purpose in accordance with the labour functions of the professional standard “Teacher”: legal, subject, methodological and psychological-pedagogical blocks. Each option consisted of 25 tasks. The maximum participant in the diagnostics could score 100 points. The interpretation of the level of professional deficits was carried out in accordance with the scale recommended by the Ministry of Education. The results of the diagnostic work were processed using visual and mathematical- statistical methods implemented within the tools and libraries of the Python programming language.
                    Results and scientific novelty
                    . The authors identified the target blocks corresponding to certain labour functions of a teacher. When performing the tasks from the identified target blocks, teachers experience the greatest and least professional difficulties. The authors identified control and measuring materials, which are associated to be the most difficult. The deficit level was analysed among subject teachers. The authors separately analysed the results of testing in the field of inclusiveness and individualisation of the educational process, the formation of digital competencies in the context of teachers of the humanities, natural sciences and primary school teachers. A correlation analysis of block diagnostic results was carried out. The influence of the territorial factor on the differentiation of test results was analysed. Difficulties, equally pronounced for both urban and rural teachers, in most cases are associated with the unwillingness of teachers to fully solve professional tasks in the formation of functional literacy of schoolchildren, the development of inclusive and personalised learning; with insufficient knowledge of the psychological and pedagogical features of the development of children of different ages to resolve conflict situations.
                    Practical significance
                    . The results obtained and the conclusions drawn can become the basis for the preparation of methodological recommendations in the field of organising the educational environment for advanced training courses, taking into account teachers’ urgent needs.

 abstract = {Background: There is increasing interest regarding the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in medical education and the studies revealed about existing gap in knowledge and application of artificial intelligence. The aim of current study was to find out the perception of medical faculty members about artificial intelligence in medical education and the level of awareness regarding the basic concepts of artificial intelligence. Methods: A qualitative exploratory approach was conducted. A self-designed, self-explanatory questionnaire was used. The questionnaire was disseminated using google form. The link of the questionnaire was emailed to the chosen faculty members and appointment for the telephonic interview was taken. On the given date and time, they were called for the telephonic interviews and the calls were recorded. After recording all the calls, the data was transcribed from each recorded phone call. After transcription the data was coded and themes were identified for final analysis. Results: Majority of participants explained artificial intelligence as an advance data calculator while some were not aware of practical applications of artificial intelligence in the field of medicine. Majority of participants recommended that medical curriculum should be revised with incorporation of basic concepts of artificial intelligence based-medical education and computer education along with it. Workshops and seminars, CME on artificial intelligence to be conducted as a part of regular faculty development programs. Many participants predicted that healthcare professionals will be replaced with the artificial intelligence based computer programs for the diagnosis of diseases in the future. Conclusion: Current study made an important observation that there was the lack of conceptual knowledge about artificial intelligence and its applications, it could be due to the fact that the healthcare providers are more focused towards their own subject specialties, that leaves them with less time in exploring the computer based technologies.

 abstract = {The development of education today is not only centered on content or material that is used as learning material. Now, education is also adapting technology where technological developments are a challenge for the world of education to continue to develop themselves in terms of using technology which makes it easier for parties involved in education to prepare, implement and evaluate educational processes and outcomes. In addition to the need to adapt to technological developments, the world of education also needs to adjust its learning methods so that they are in accordance with the technology that is carried. Most of the Covid-19 pandemic can be handled by the government and also the people in most areas in Indonesia. So that adaptation by the world of education related to learning methods that remain technology-based can be done more intensively. Education in the era of increasingly rapid technological development changes the role of educators/teachers. The role of the teacher is not currently the main center of learning, but as a facilitator of learning and learning has led to an independent learning model or self-learning. Paradigm changes and new adaptations of educational methods in the era of disruption result in a greater percentage of technology involvement, and human resources are needed, in this case, teachers who are able to master technology. Based on the phenomenon of education, technology and various changes that occur that need to be responded to properly, it gives an idea for work team from Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana to hold a Community Service activity regarding the use of Google for Education as a form of continuation where during a pandemic, Google-based technology becomes an option in carrying out the education process. This community service activity is carried out in the form of technical guidance which will accommodate 4 categories of practical use of Google for Education in schools, especially for Early Childhood and Elementary School teachers. The result of this activity was amazing where most of the teachers get the benefits such as knowledge development and skill improvements.},

 abstract = {The problem of assessing the quality of education today is relevant. There are many problematic questions: What should the technologies for implementing the links between school teachers and schoolchildren’s learning outcomes be? How to identify these connections and work with them? Is it possible to establish multidimensional relationships between the activities of a teacher, the results of students, between the competencies of a teacher and the quality of their professional training at the university? In Tomsk Oblast, the research is being carried out in two areas: (1) development and testing of a technology that makes it possible to analyze the learning outcomes of schoolchildren and establish the relationship between these results and the level of teachers’ professionalism, (2) establishment of a relationship between the identified deficits in the subject and methodological competencies of teachers and the quality of their professional training at a pedagogical university. In the first direction of work, the results of research on assessing the level of school teachers’ competence were summarized. The study used machine learning methods. The data obtained in educational institutions of Tomsk Oblast for the period from 2015 to 2019 (unified state exam in mathematics, physics, Russian language, and social studies) were processed. This work made it possible to identify learning difficulties among schoolchildren, and then to connect these difficulties with a lack of competencies in the professional activities of their teachers. In the second direction of the research, the goal is set: the development of a new concept for the assessment and development of the professionalism of teachers in the system of higher pedagogical education. The object of study is the system of continuous professional development of teachers in the system of teacher education. The study uses the methods of theoretical analysis, structural analysis, analysis of products of activity, focus group, method of expert assessments, educational design. The types of interdependence of professional and educational deficits of different subjects of educational activities are described. These types of connections are important for achieving the integrity of the assessment system, developing the professionalism of professors of teacher education and structuring managerial actions to ensure the quality of general and teacher education in the logic of their relationship. The following conclusions are made. (1) The proposed concept of assessing and developing the professionalism of professors of a pedagogical university is an element of a system for achieving the quality of school and university pedagogical education in the “school student – teacher – university teacher” logic. (2) An assessment of the level of teachers’ professional competences shows deficits that need to be addressed. (3) Changes in the preparation of students can be based on the analysis of professional deficits of teachers, which makes it possible to change the preparation of students, including ensuring the prevention of deficits.},

 abstract = {Background Medical faculty development programs (FDPs) often lack hands-on training in teaching skills. Microteaching, a short, focused teaching practice, could be a feasible way to bridge this gap. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of including hands-on microteaching in a medical FDP in India. Methodology This mixed-methods study involved fresh medical faculty members who never attended FDP on the basics of medical education technologies, stakeholders, and students from a recently established autonomous medical institute of national importance in India. Participants completed a pre-test survey on their teaching skills and received a hands-on microteaching session during an FDP. After the session, participants completed a post-test survey and provided feedback on the feasibility and acceptability of hands-on microteaching in the program. Program evaluation was done by application of Kirkpatrick's Model levels one, two, and three. Results According to the Kirkpatrick Model of Evaluation level one (Reaction), the participants reported improved teaching skills and greater confidence in their ability to teach after the microteaching session. They also reported that hands-on microteaching was an effective way to learn teaching skills and receive feedback. Stakeholders opined that microteaching is a very effective tool for improving teaching skills and should be a part of FDP. Evaluation at level two (Learning) shows that there was a significant improvement in the mean score of post-tests. As per level three (Behaviour Change) evaluation, the majority of the students informed that there is observable improvement in the effectiveness of teaching of faculties in the past two months, i.e., since the participation of faculty in hands-on microteaching in FDP. Conclusions Hands-on microteaching could be a feasible and effective way to enhance the teaching skills of medical faculty members in India. The study findings suggest that including hands-on microteaching in FDPs could help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical teaching skills.},

Interviews with teachers demonstrate that in assessing the positive aspects of the transition to individual learning paths, such aspects have been taken note of as the possibility of focusing on one’s own interests, increased motivation and desire for professional development in a competitive environment, as well as simplification of reporting as a result of digitization. What teachers are apprehensive about is a decline in the fundamental nature of training and the de-professionalization of students, the collapse of stable social ties and identities of teachers, subpar living conditions due to continuous spatial mobility, and uncertainty when it comes to workload. The study showed that a fifth of students are not satisfied with the learning outcomes under new conditions and experience difficulty adapting in mixed groups with other students of different specialties. The variability and individualization of education is not yet a priority for students enrolled in traditional programs. Students pursuing individual study paths do not realize the many advantages the new system provides when it comes to forming the personal qualities necessary for successful selfrealization, due to them lacking the opportunity to compare their form of education to what is considered traditional.},

 abstract = {The emergence of increasingly powerful AI technologies calls for the design and development of K-12 AI literacy curricula that can support students who will be entering a profoundly changed labor market. However, developing, implementing, and scaling AI literacy curricula poses significant challenges. It will be essential to develop a robust, evidence-based AI education research foundation that can inform AI literacy curriculum development. Unlike K-12 science and mathematics education, there is not currently a research foundation for K-12 AI education. In this article we provide a component-based definition of AI literacy, present the need for implementing AI literacy education across all grade bands, and argue for the creation of research programs across four areas of AI education: (1) K-12 AI Learning & Technology; (2) K-12 AI Education Integration into STEM, Language Arts, and Social Science Education; (3) K-12 AI Professional Development for Teachers and Administrators; and (4) K-12 AI Assessment.},

 abstract = {Uncovering patterns and trends in vast, ever-increasing quantities of data has been enabled by different machine learning methods and techniques used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Permeating many aspects of our lives and influencing our choices, development in this field continues to advance and increasingly impacts us as individuals and our society. The risks and unintended effects such as bias from input data or algorithm design have recently stirred discourse about how to inform and teach AI in K-12 education. As AI is a new topic not only for pupils in K-12 but also for teachers, new skill sets are required that enable critical engagement with AI. AI literacy is trying to close the gap between research and practical knowledge transfer of AI-related skills. Teachers' AI-related technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) are important factors for AI literacy. However, as teachers' perspectives, beliefs and views impact both the interpretation and operationalisation of curriculum. this study explores teachers' and teacher educators' understanding and preconceptions of AI to inform teacher education and professional development. To gain a comprehensive understanding of teachers’ conceptualisations regarding AI an anonymous questionnaire together with focus group discussions were employed. The qualitative content analysis underpinned by the theoretical framework Intelligent TPACK reveals that teachers' AI-related content knowledge is generally gained through incidental learning and often results in pre- and misconceptions of AI. Our analysis also revealed several potential challenges for teachers in achieving core constructs of Intelligent TPACK, examples of such challenges are vague and unclear guidelines in both policy and curriculum, a lack of understanding of AI and its limitations, as well as emotional responses related to participants' preconceptions. These insights are important to consider in designing teacher education and professional development related to AI literacy.},

 abstract = {Reflection is hypothesized to be a key component for teachers’ professional development and is often assessed and facilitated through written reflections in university-based teacher education. Empirical research shows that reflection-related competencies are domain-dependent and multi-faceted. However, assessing reflections is complex. Given this complexity, novel methodological tools such as non-linear, algorithmic models can help explore unseen relationships and better determine quality correlates for written reflections. Consequently, this study utilized machine learning methods to explore quality correlates for written reflections in physics on a standardized teaching situation. N = 110 pre- and in-service physics teachers were instructed to reflect upon a standardized teaching situation in physics displayed in a video vignette. The teachers’ written reflections were analyzed with a machine learning model which classified sentences in the written reflections according to elements in a reflection-supporting model. A quality indicator called level of structure (LOS) was devised and further used to validate machine learning classifications against experts’ judgements. Analyses show that LOS is positively correlated with experts’ judgements on reflection quality. We conclude that LOS of a written reflection is one important indicator for high-quality written reflections which is able to exclude typical quality correlates such as text length. With the help of the machine learning model, LOS can be useful to assess pre-service physics teachers written reflections.},

This study presented a comprehensive review of the current state of research on ML education from K-12, drawing attention to both current research hotspots and gaps in the literature that should be addressed by future studies. We looked at 45 articles published at conferences and in journals that focused on certain aspects of K-12 ML education via these four lenses: curriculum development, technical development, pedagogical development, and teacher training/professional development. We found that (a) there is a lack of ML materials for K-8 and informal settings, (b) more research is needed on how ML can be integrated into subject domains other than computing, (c) most studies focus on pedagogical development, (d) there is a lack of teacher professional development programs, and (e) more evidence of the societal and ethical implications of ML should be considered in future research. Although the study's authors note several caveats and suggestions for further study, the findings are nonetheless applicable for improving the quality of research in the rapidly expanding field of K-12 ML by educating teachers, researchers, and instructional designers.},

 abstract = {La formazione in servizio degli insegnanti di lingue deve affrontare due questioni critiche: il modello basato sulle lezioni degli esperti si è dimostrato inefficiente nel garantire un aumento significativo dei risultati degli studenti; eppure, la domanda di formazione è in aumento da anni, l’offerta no. Questo saggio suggerisce la possibilità di far fronte alle due questioni di cui sopra capovolgendo il modello tradizionale di formazione degli insegnanti. Il modello tradizionale è lineare, ha una sola direzione, da chi sa a chi non sa o sa meno; il modello capovolto è circolare, cioè si basa su due cerchi. Cerchio 1: il punto di partenza è una scuola (o una rete di scuole, o un’associazione di insegnanti, ecc.) dove un insegnante, formato per essere un tutor, organizza la formazione. In primo luogo, i tirocinanti condividono la loro esperienza sul tema del modulo di formazione, poi il tutor fornisce input scientifici attraverso video, e infine guida la creazione e la sperimentazione di materiali didattici da utilizzare a scuola, completando così il cerchio 1, “da scuola a scuola”. Il cerchio 2 riguarda l’interazione tra il tutor e la ricerca in linguistica didattica. Il cerchio inizia quando un buon insegnante contatta dipartimenti universitari, centri di ricerca e simili, per essere formato; il centro di ricerca fornisce video lezioni da utilizzare nel cerchio 1; il feedback del tutor, insieme ai suoi articoli su riviste per insegnanti e alle domande di ricerca per ulteriori ricerche, completa il cerchio 2, ‘dalla ricerca alla ricerca’. Sono descritti cinque progetti di formazione circolare.   Training language teachers: is it possible to flip the pattern? In-service training for language teachers faces two critical issues: the model based on expert instruction has proven ineffective in ensuring significant increases in student achievement; yet, the demand for training has been increasing for years, the supply has not. This essay suggests the possibility of addressing the above two issues by flipping the traditional teacher training model. The traditional model is linear, having only one direction, from those who know to those who do not know or know less; the flipped model is circular, that is, it is based on two circles. Circle 1: The starting point is a school (or a network of schools, or a teachers’ association, etc.) where a teacher, trained to be a mentor, organizes the training. First, the trainees share their experience on the topic of the training module, then the tutor provides scientific input through videos, and finally guides the creation and testing of teaching materials to be used at school, thus completing Circle 1, “school to school”. Circle 2 is about the interaction between the tutor and research in educational linguistics. The circle begins when a good tutor contacts university departments, research centers, etc., to be trained; the research center provides video lessons for use in Circle 1; the tutor’s feedback, along with his or her articles in teacher journals and research questions for further research, completes Circle 2, ‘from research to research’. Five circle training projects are described.},

 abstract = {Background: It is evident that physical activity (PA) programmes implemented in schools were not effective in improving PA behaviours among adolescents. This study investigated students' perceptions of barriers to PA among inactive English adolescents in secondary schools based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The study compared barriers faced by inactive and active groups participating in sports and PA in secondary schools to identify sources of behaviour contributing to inactivity.
Methods: A pre-intervention online survey was distributed to affiliated schools by 233 Teaching Schools Alliances (TSAs) as part of the monitoring and evaluation of the Secondary Teacher Training study. Data were cross-tabulated to analyse activity levels and behavioural barriers for active and inactive groups, using the COM-B domains. The research team followed a seven-step process to categorise barriers based on their relevant domain in the TDF mapped to the COM-B.
Results: The findings were derived from one of the most extensive surveys of adolescents ever undertaken involving 200,623 active and 8,231 inactive respondents. The study identified 52 barriers and 68 behaviours that prevent adolescents from participating in PA. Psychological and social barriers were found to affect all activity levels, genders, and ethnic groups, with a lack of confidence and self-consciousness being the most prevalent. Certain demographic groups, such as those from minority ethnic groups and disabled individuals, were found to be overrepresented among inactive populations. The finding of the study indicated that there were common barriers that affected both inactive and active groups, with further similarity when examining barriers between active and inactive girls. The study also found that girls were more likely to experience the main barriers compared to boys, while inactive boys were more likely to encounter these barriers compared to active boys. The findings suggest that common barriers could be addressed across the population, while recognising some differences in demographics, and the need to provide personalised support. Targeted interventions are also suggested for all girls and inactive boys.
Conclusion: This study highlights the range of barriers that impact adolescents and provides insight into potential mechanisms for behaviour change, including intervention functions, policy categories, and evidence-based behaviour change tools. The study highlights the need for further research to address the barriers to PA among adolescents, particularly those who are inactive. Utilising the findings of this study, future research should investigate the effectiveness of novel digital exercise interventions and policies in increasing PA levels among children and adolescents. Complex digital exercise interventions, including conversational AI solutions, could provide personalised tools to identify and revolutionise support around the multitude of barriers that impact adolescents globally."For the purpose of open access, the author has applied a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission."},

 abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on teacher leadership, specifically examining whether AI is expanding or regressing teacher leadership, as perceived by teachers who were using AI in their teaching practices. Using a qualitative research design, the study employed semi-structured interviews to collect data from 13 teachers from five countries. The data were then analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings of the study indicated that the use of AI has the potential to both expand and regress teacher leadership. AI can expand teacher leadership by providing tools for personalization, curriculum development, automating administrative tasks, and supporting professional development. However, AI was also viewed to be regressing teacher leadership, by narrowing the role because technology was taking over some of its aspects. Five sets of competencies were suggested by teachers for teacher leaders to sustain their roles in an AI era. The study concludes that the impact of AI on teacher leadership depends on how it is implemented and integrated into the education system. It highlights the importance of continued research and training in this area to inform future education policies and practices.},

 abstract = {Findings from research on the education of teachers show that student teachers lack competence in the utilization of digital media and often fail to see the added value in using digital concepts in classrooms. Teacher training institutions are faced with the central challenge of providing student teachers and teachers with adaptive learning opportunities for their competence in digital areas. In the context of various teaching subjects, this raises questions about specific starting points and the actual needs of students, as well as university course offerings. The present study tackles this topic and explores the commonalities and differences between student teachers from three subject clusters: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); language literature arts (LLA); and social sciences (SOCS). The questionnaire-based study examines student teachers' self-assessments of their abilities in terms of digital media, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching. Group comparisons show that STEM student teachers rate themselves better in competence facets such as technological knowledge, technological content knowledge, and technological pedagogical knowledge, although their attitudes and motivation towards learning with digital media do not differ. Despite the different interrelation effects of investigated influencing factors on motivation depending on subject clusters, the findings suggest the promotion of technological competencies and positive attitudes to increase motivation.},

 abstract = {Introduction. Implementation of innovative approaches to personnel management in organizations is extremely relevant for high-quality professional development of personnel. In Ukraine, it is mandatory to take into account the specifics of the war period and its impact on personnel management. The purpose of the paper is to research innovative approaches to the organization's personnel management by systematizing current scientific results and taking into account the peculiarities of the wartime period in Ukraine. Results. Today, the implementation of innovative approaches to personnel management largely depends on the professional development of the organization's employees. According to the obtained results, there are many studies that consider innovative approaches to personnel management, which are based on several main features: 1) by the main areas of personnel management; 2) according to new trends in personnel management, such as automation of personnel management, including the use of artificial intelligence; 3) according to innovative HR policies and practices used in the organization. In wartime, the security of personnel and their families is the basis for further implementation of innovative approaches to personnel management. The minimum maintenance budget calculated under the current required structure somewhat limits innovation in wartime personnel management, but it provides a stable basis for the further development of companies after the war. Conclusions. The development of new KPIs, as well as the existing readiness of organizations to involve personnel displaced by the war in Ukraine, are promising directions for the implementation of innovative approaches to the organization's personnel management. The results of the study are recommended for the further implementation in both the field of education and business.},

 abstract = {Metaverse is a virtual, interactive digital environment that provides students with a new learning scenario through technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. In order to provide a more attractive and effective English learning environment, researchers have begun to introduce meta-universe technology into English language teaching. In meta-universe-enabled basic English teaching, students can interact with the virtual world through immersive learning experiences that simulate real-life scenarios and improve their language skills. Metaverse technology can also provide students with personalized learning paths and resources. In addition, social interaction in the metaverse environment promotes the development of students' intercultural communication and cooperation skills. However, metaverse-enabled basic English language teaching also faces some challenges, such as the cost of technological equipment, teacher training and technical support, etc. Future research needs to further explore how to maximize the effect of metaverse technology in English language teaching.},

 abstract = {This study aimed to assess the pedagogical frameworks for developing future teachers using digital education technology. The mixed-methods design, which combines quantitative and qualitative approaches, was employed to develop this study. Three hundred seventeen teacher candidates who are enrolled at several universities in Kazakhstan make up the research team. The researchers created a semi-structured interview form and an attitude scale toward digital technology in order to gather research data. The data was determined to be regularly distributed. Therefore, descriptive statistics, the T-test, and one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were employed to assess them. The descriptive analysis method was applied to study the research’s qualitative data. The study’s findings showed that most pre-service teachers who took part in it thought that teacher training programs based on digital technology had adequate pedagogical conditions. Based on its results, the study offers recommendations.},

 abstract = {The potential effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on the teaching of anatomy are unclear. We explore the hypothetical situation of human body donors being replaced by AI human body simulations and reflect on two separate ethical concerns: first, whether it is permissible to replace donors with AI human body simulations in the dissection room when the consequences of doing so are unclear, and second, the overarching ethical significance of AI use in anatomy education. To do this, we highlight the key benefits of student exposure to the dissection room and body donors, including nontechnical, discipline-independent skills, awareness and interaction with applied bioethics, and professional identity formation. We suggest that the uniqueness of the dissection room experience and the importance of the key benefits accompanying this exposure outweigh the potential and so far unknown benefits of AI technology in this space. Further, the lack of engagement with bioethical principles that are intimately intertwined with the dissection room experience may have repercussions for future healthcare professional development. We argue that interaction with body donors must be protected and maintained and not replaced with AI human body donor simulations. Any move away from this foundation of anatomy education requires scrutiny. In light of the possible adoption of AI technologies into anatomy teaching, it is necessary that medical educators reflect on the dictum that the practice of healthcare, and anatomy, is a uniquely human endeavor.},

 abstract = {Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been part of our lives for some time, the launch of the Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) has given it renewed attention. While most of these debates are about higher education in general, this article focuses on schoolteacher education and teacher training. This research aimed to determine the contribution of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT in lesson planning, critical thinking and openness in education. The research used a qualitative approach and document analysis following an interpretative paradigm. The findings reveal that generative language models such as ChatGPT can provide specific materials and support mechanisms, such as lesson plans, to schoolteachers and student teachers. It also showed that ChatGPT has levelled the playing field by opening access to lesson plans to all teachers. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is crucial to approach these models with caution and critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases, understanding that they are tools to support teaching and learning and do not replace teachers. The study’s contribution lies in ChatGPT-generated lesson plans’ implications and the enhancement of critical thinking for teacher education, and it also underscores the need for further research to explore best practices for integrating ChatGPT in lesson planning.},

 abstract = {Co-sponsored by the Information Policy and Information Ethics special interest groups (SIGs), this proposal is for a pair of traditional 90-minute speaker panels, facilitated by the respective SIG convenors and supporting interlocutors, which will address the contested nature of the public in policy and implications for educators, including the ALISE community.
 The first co-sponsored panel explores the past decade’s ramped-up effort among activists to defund or use punitive measures against public institutions that support and enact diversity, equity, inclusion, and decolonization (DEID) efforts. For example, many libraries have purposefully endeavored to increase the diversity of their collections and programs with respect to BIPOC and LGBTQ+ authors, speakers, and themed displays. Many school systems have invested in DEID curriculum and resources to better serve their students, and universities have invested in staff and faculty development to support students, staff, and faculty of color. However, some community members and politicians are opposed to any DEID efforts and thus seek to eliminate them, using either legal or punitive financial means. This panel will give attention to the historical context of DEID efforts and current implications for public institutions; lobbying; advocacy work in public institutions; and legislation and states/provincial/territory rights and federalism. The Information Policy SIG convenor, with the support of interlocutors, guides the audience in a critical discussion of implications for multiple constituent groups (e.g., library users, people working within library and information institutions, trustees, mayors, legislators, police and security workforce, journalists). At the close, participants are encouraged to surface connecting topics and potential conversationalists for ongoing engagement co-hosted by the Information Policy and Information Ethics SIGs.
 The second co-sponsored panel pivots attention to instances of censorship and self-censorship among some of the people who work in higher education and K-12 public educational institutions and their libraries therein in various national contexts. The topics covered in this panel include the effect of censorship and self-censorship on teaching, learning, and curriculum; the contested nature of intellectual freedom, represented through specific cases of censorship, challenge and critique; implications for ethical AI in research and higher education; workplace expression, and employer; rights and responsibilities of academic freedom; and the use and abuse of civility codes. The Information Ethics SIG convenor, with the support of interlocutors, will guide the audience in a discussion of implications for the education of library and information professionals and those individuals who are engaged in teaching them. This includes critical discussion with respect to: employees and scholars at risk (e.g., equity deserving, precariously employed or under-employed, international work); threats on tenure and tenured members of academic staff (e.g. faculty, archivists, librarians); bargaining and job action; curtailing of academic freedom; declining collegial/shared governance in higher education; the importance of strong administrative and trustee support in our educational institutions; and related legislative priorities.

 abstract = {In the 1970s, research on artificial intelligence in education emerged with the aim of acknowledging and accommodating the psychological aspects of the learning process. Since then, its applications have evolved and it is now used for student learning and assessment, teachers’ pedagogical practice, management of educational institutions, and lifelong learning. Nevertheless, the ethical challenges of educational programmes using these systems have not been thoroughly studied. Anchored on the theoretical frame of dialogic ethics, this paper presents a section of a participatory futures research project. The goal of the research is to develop a toolkit that educators can use to ensure a smooth and ethical transition to artificial intelligence-based education while preserving the interests of educational development. This paper emphasises the need for an informed and participatory process that involves all stakeholders and begins with an expert consultation through the Delphi method, the results of which allowed the construction of eight hypothetical futures scenarios. These scenarios provide evidence that examining the ethics of using artificial intelligence systems presents an opportunity to reflect on the ethics of education as a whole. They highlight the challenge of balancing the benefits and drawbacks of such systems, especially concerning educational goals and the interplay between diverse educational actors and personal development in educational settings. The study outcomes are intended to encourage discussions on the integration of ethical artificial intelligence in education and facilitate the continuing professional development of teachers by equipping them with scenarios that can be used as a resource for training purposes.},

 abstract = {This study analyzes how medical educational programs are evolving to address the digital transformation in healthcare. Surveys, curriculum analysis, and faculty interviews were utilized to examine technology integration. Findings indicate electronic medical records are considered the most significant digital achievement, though only 4% of beginner faculty emphasized telemedicine. Curriculum analysis revealed increasing modifications related to technology, informatics, and data analytics, especially in certain specialties like biochemistry and biophysics. Interviews provided insights into digital integration opportunities and challenges. A key theme was re-evaluating pedagogical strategies as students rely more on technology. Interviewees also envisioned emerging innovations enabling personalized, immersive learning, but cautioned against over-dependence on technology impeding development of clinical skills and humanism. Overall, while core medical fundamentals remain unchanged, curriculum content is adapting to incorporate new competencies like digital literacy. However, strategic integration remains crucial to balance technology’s benefits and drawbacks. Challenges like technical difficulties, costs, and over-reliance must be addressed. The outlook is increased technology utilization, with solutions like AI-enabled adaptive learning on the horizon. However, investing in infrastructure and faculty development will be vital. Medical schools must leverage technology to elevate learning while retaining humanistic values. This study provides timely insights into medical education’s digital transformation, laying groundwork for further research on optimizing technology integration while upholding the human core of medicine.},

The extended reality of the metaverse offers a new learning environment in which additional educational roles intervene to support the teaching and learning processes. The work explores some aspects of the metaverse as a support for the initial training of teachers. It presents a study on the perceptions that student-teachers and school tutors of a teaching qualification path have, specifically, of the so-called ‘non-player characters’ (NPC) tutor and peers, in the metaverse. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected via mixed questionnaire and analyzed via descriptive statistics and QDA. The analysis found some differences in expectations between student-teachers and school tutors with respect to the metaverse, to the new educational roles related and, specifically, to the NPC tutor role. The triangulation of the early data is highlighting a general new look at the possibilities offered by the metaverse – in monitoring the learning program and in decision-making practices – as well as expectation about the teachers training – Artificial Intelligence relationship. The results of study regarding the perceptions of student-teachers and school tutors on the metaverse and on the role of the NPC tutor are offered as insights to be explored, through further investigations, to those responsible for teacher training courses and to the research that today investigates the learning effects of the metaverse as a potential professional training environment.},

 abstract = {The Russian education system is currently undergoing a process of digital transformation at all levels. These changes are due to socio-economic development, demographic processes, needs of society, peculiarities of production, where human potential is replaced by artificial intelligence and other environmental factors that have a significant impact on the microenvironment of an educational organization. All these processes require a change in the management model, which could meet the trends in the development of society, quickly transform and modify. The article proposes a project management model, flexible, situational, as well as organizational and pedagogical conditions that contribute to the implementation and use of the developed management model in preschool educational organizations (PEO), regardless of the form of ownership (municipal, state or private). One of the most important conditions for the transition to digital management of PEO is the professional development of teachers in the field of digital education, the practical use of digital equipment and interactive platforms in the classroom, it is also very important to select management personnel, change the scheme for appointing managers who must have competencies in the field of management , marketing, economics, risk management and personnel, and not just have a set of pedagogical knowledge, skills and abilities, as it is now. However, the implementation of the project management model at the moment turns out to be difficult, the transition to it should be phased, as the first stage, the authors of the article propose the implementation of the organizational and pedagogical conditions described in the work.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), represented by large language models, have the potential to transform health care and medical education. In particular, GAI's impact on higher education has the potential to change students' learning experience as well as faculty's teaching. However, concerns have been raised about ethical consideration and decreased reliability of the existing examinations. Furthermore, in medical education, curriculum reform is required to adapt to the revolutionary changes brought about by the integration of GAI into medical practice and research.
OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the impact of GAI on medical education curricula and explores strategies for adaptation.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the context of faculty development at a medical school in Japan. A workshop involving faculty and students was organized, and participants were divided into groups to address two research questions: (1) How does GAI affect undergraduate medical education curricula? and (2) How should medical school curricula be reformed to address the impact of GAI? The strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) framework was used, and cross-SWOT matrix analysis was used to devise strategies. Further, 4 researchers conducted content analysis on the data generated during the workshop discussions.
RESULTS: The data were collected from 8 groups comprising 55 participants. Further, 5 themes about the impact of GAI on medical education curricula emerged: improvement of teaching and learning, improved access to information, inhibition of existing learning processes, problems in GAI, and changes in physicians' professionality. Positive impacts included enhanced teaching and learning efficiency and improved access to information, whereas negative impacts included concerns about reduced independent thinking and the adaptability of existing assessment methods. Further, GAI was perceived to change the nature of physicians' expertise. Three themes emerged from the cross-SWOT analysis for curriculum reform: (1) learning about GAI, (2) learning with GAI, and (3) learning aside from GAI. Participants recommended incorporating GAI literacy, ethical considerations, and compliance into the curriculum. Learning with GAI involved improving learning efficiency, supporting information gathering and dissemination, and facilitating patient involvement. Learning aside from GAI emphasized maintaining GAI-free learning processes, fostering higher cognitive domains of learning, and introducing more communication exercises.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the profound impact of GAI on medical education curricula and provides insights into curriculum reform strategies. Participants recognized the need for GAI literacy, ethical education, and adaptive learning. Further, GAI was recognized as a tool that can enhance efficiency and involve patients in education. The study also suggests that medical education should focus on competencies that GAI hardly replaces, such as clinical experience and communication. Notably, involving both faculty and students in curriculum reform discussions fosters a sense of ownership and ensures broader perspectives are encompassed.},

The solution of the first task also involved the analysis of existing theoretical approaches to the disclosure of the essence of the concept of "inclusive competence". The views of modern scientists on its interpretation were considered, structural components were highlighted. In this study, inclusive competence was defined as a component of a teacher's professional competence and was considered as an integrative personal education that allows him to implement professional and pedagogical functions, taking into account the peculiarities of inclusive practice. The components of inclusive competence of pedagogical university students are motivational-personal, cognitive and activity. To determine the current level of inclusive competence of students, the levels and criteria of this professional quality of future teachers (motivational, personal, cognitive and activity) were determined. In the course of the study, it was found that the majority of students have an inclusive competence formed insufficiently. Future teachers are experiencing serious difficulties in organizing joint education of children with normotypic development and children with disabilities. Hence, there is a need to develop and implement a model of the process of formation of inclusive competence in the practice of university training of teaching staff.},

 abstract = {The modern world is heading towards what could be considered its fourth industrial revolution, driven by technological advancements and artificial intelligence. This ongoing revolution, led by international organizations and global technology corporations, brings about a global standardization of education, as well as the expansion of the knowledge society, cognitive capitalism, and immaterial production. Amid these transformations stands the recent social syndemic that has spread worldwide, further exacerbating its effects through the social crisis that has been brewing since the dismantling of the welfare state and the rise of neoliberalism. Additionally, the transformation of control mechanisms has resulted in a renewed power dynamic. Therefore, creating new resistance movements that are capable of addressing modern social problems. These present times pose a challenge for 21st-century schools and teacher training. Thus, it is crucial to start thinking about education as a conduit for innovation and transformation by strengthening the connection between practice, thought, and resistance. This can be achieved through approaches such as popular education. By building on its historical and political foundation, popular education develops proposals that emphasize diversity, critical thinking, and the holistic development of individuals.},

This paper introduces creative and collaborative sensemaking with GenAI as an alternative form of academic and professional development to spark reflection on the implications of this technology for educators and to increase GenAI literacy. By combining human and AI-generated text in iterative loops, we created a text and a creative process to collectively investigate the use of GenAI in education. Collaborative poetic inquiry, an arts-based research method, was used in tandem with generative experiments using AI tools, culminating in an ode to collaborative sensemaking. Drawing on the authors’ collective experience as a group of educational professionals and academics, we then critically analysed how GenAI may impact educators and augment creative practices to generate new insights. Further implications for practice from this sensemaking with GenAI in education are discussed.},

 abstract = {As a formal institutional structure, university libraries represent at their core the collective knowledge and opportunity for deep personalised learning and professional development across the traditionalist subject matters. As professionals working within rapidly-evolving fields of online learning, in particular those around Learning Design, we do not have this same level of access or historical record as more traditional subjects (Elmborg, 2011). The Digital Education Library is an exploration of bridging this gap in a collaborative, co-curated, less formal approach to professional development.   In adapting the library structure to meet the needs and breadth of our team, we also have the opportunity to modernise for access and inclusion. This design accounts for the needs of modern hybrid work models and encourages recognition of the breadth of skills, knowledge, and interests existing within our own team structures. The [institution]’s Digital Education division comprises of four smaller areas; a Learning Design, Learning Media, Learning Environments, and Exams & e-Assessments teams, under its broader banner. These interconnected roles each add value and contexts to library content and design (Ilahi et al., 2019). With a diverse team from dispersed locations, curation and access to digital resources and physical books are embedded in the design to normalise and facilitate hybrid teams.   With these factors considered, building a Digital Education library gathers a broad range of themes related to third space design needs. The platform chosen utilises a hybrid approach (UNESCO, 2003), alongside a physical library of works, focused on not just instructional design, but a broad range of adjacent themes related to the areas of the Digital Education division – assessment design, media and graphic design, user experience, learning design, academic development, as well as works focused on the scholarship of teaching & learning, leadership, team culture, and data literacy. The range of themes explored is intentionally designed to foster partnerships between areas of the team, and hold intentional and visible space for professional development. Agency within the team is also fostered through opportunity for co-creation, through the option for team members to easily share resources they’ve found interesting, with relevant tags, descriptors, and templates. This presentation will explore the Digital Education Library and its design process, from its dual perspective roles as both a library of digital education, and a digital library of education.},

 abstract = {In the last decade, research on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in education has steadily grown. Many studies have demonstrated the potential of these technologies to improve school administration processes, enhance students' learning experiences, simplify teachers' daily tasks, and broaden opportunities for lifelong learning. However, the enthusiasm surrounding these possibilities may overshadow the ethical challenges posed by these systems. This systematic literature review is designed to explore the ethical dimensions surrounding the utilisation of these technologies within the defined timeframe (2011–022) in the field of education. It undertakes a thorough analysis of various applications and objectives, with a particular focus on pinpointing any inherent shortcomings within the existing body of literature. The paper discusses how cultural differences, inclusion, and emotions have been addressed in this context. Finally, it explores the capacity building efforts that have been put in place, their main targets, as well as guidelines and frameworks available for the ethical use of these systems. This review sheds light on the research's blind spots and provides insights to help rethink education ethics in the age of AI. Additionally, the paper explores implications for teacher training, as educators play a critical role in ensuring the ethical use of AI in education. This review aims to stimulate ethical debates around artificial intelligence that recognise it as a non-neutral tool, and to view it as an opportunity to strengthen the debates on the ethics of education itself.},

We argue that rather than looking at the process of adopting AI solutions by teachers from a technology perspective or how teachers contribute to designing and developing such tools, we take the perspective of the teacher and ask how such tools are meaningfully integrated into teacher practices. In our conceptual paper, we illustrate the case of a novel approach to the teacher training model where the development of teacher' professional vision and professional learning is combined with the design of the AI solutions. We argue the importance of involving teachers into the design of AI solutions through professional learning models to support teachers to develop knowledge-based reasoning skills and at the same time to learn about pedagogical concepts and develop new mental models.},

 abstract = {The integration of open educational resources (OER) in the educational curricula of universities and educational organizations has gained tremendous popularity. However, there is a gap in research on teachers’ attitudes toward OER in many developing countries. Using a mixed-methods approach, this study explored the use of OER by online and face-to-face teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) in Iran. A total of 62 teachers (31 online teachers and 31 face-to-face teachers) participated in the study. Survey and interview results indicated that there were significant differences between online and face-to-face teachers’ attitudes toward OER. Online teachers had a more positive attitude toward OER than face-to-face teachers. The perceived benefits of OER included developing the flexibility of curricula, encouraging personalized learning, and offering pedagogical options for teachers. There were several perceived OER-based challenges in the educational context of Iran as well. The challenges included teachers’ uncertainty about copyright issues, the low quality of OER, teachers’ low levels of digital literacy, teachers’ unawareness of the existence of OER, the lack of quality control over OER, the lack of credibility of OER content, and the lack of up-to-dateness of OER. There were also significant differences between participants’ perspectives on the types and frequency of using OER. More specifically, online teachers used OER for teaching practices more frequently than face-to-face teachers. Participants perceived that they needed various types of training for the appropriate use of OER. This study proposes several implications for renewing and improving teacher training/education programs and material development projects.},

The findings challenge the notion that distance education is only suitable for extreme conditions. Key educational process participants, especially in fields like "Journalism," view well-organized distance education as comparable to traditional and extramural learning methods. It enhances the computer technology skills of both teachers and students, proves to be the most inclusive educational format, lessens financial burdens, broadens professional development opportunities, aids in the internationalization of education, and serves as a marketing tool for attracting prospective students.

 abstract = {Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is profoundly transforming various sectors of society, including education. Internationally, the teaching of AI is emerging as a necessity, underscored by UNESCO's Sustainable Development Goals (2020). In a broad sense, AI is becoming a cross-cutting theme across all areas of knowledge, being a daily presence in all of our lives. While the utilization of AI in the educational context sparks considerable interest, the lack of specific guidelines can impede its adoption by educators less familiar with the field. From a technological standpoint, numerous initiatives have given rise to platforms dedicated to AI learning. However, these platforms have not reinforced teaching, as deficiencies in educators' computational training are observed. In order to contribute to this perspective, the present proposal outlines a framework designed for professors who seek to introduce AI as a pedagogical resource in their teaching practices. This guide encompasses stages from problem selection to comparative evaluation between AI-based solutions and traditional approaches while considering ethical implications and the explainability of methods. Through this proposal, the aim is to empower educators to embrace AI as an enriching tool in the contemporary educational landscape. Up to this point, studies and assessments of the methodological framework have been developed within the scope of teaching in Basic Education. Preliminary results indicate the user-friendliness of these resources for classroom use and teacher training. Keywords: Artificial Intelligence. Teacher Formation.

 abstract = {Despite the benefits of artificial intelligence-assisted language learning (AIALL) for students and teachers, the scientific literature in this field remains relatively scarce, especially regarding the perceptions of language teachers. This paper aims to narrow this research gap by considering the potential cultural differences between in-service language teachers by comparing and contrasting the attitudes of language teachers located in different contexts (i.e., Eastern and Western countries) towards AIALL. Following a qualitative research approach and a descriptive, transversal, and correlational method, a six-question semi-structured interview was designed and administered to unveil the perceptions of six language teachers located both in Eastern (i.e., Vietnam, Iran, and Indonesia) and Western (i.e., Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom) countries. The findings show that the participants were positive about the potential of AIALL for teaching and learning languages, although they all showed a certain anxiety regardless of their context. Moreover, and although there were shared concerns, differences were found between Eastern and Western participants, especially concerning equitable access, balance between language skills, and ethical aspects. This study reveals that teacher training is essential to introduce AIALL in the classroom, and that practitioners need to rethink assessment to avoid plagiarism and cheating, but also to take advantage of AIALL.},

 abstract = {In Alto Adige, il trilinguismo istituzionale (tedesco, italiano, ladino) e la diglossia convivono con nuove lingue e varietà portate nel territorio grazie ai flussi migratori. La crescente diversità linguistica e culturale della Provincia di Bolzano ha un forte impatto sulla vita scolastica quotidiana e pone nuove sfide ai docenti: l’inclusione e la valorizzazione di tutte le lingue che alunni e alunne portano in classe, così come la mobilitazione dei loro interi repertori linguistici per l’apprendimento, richiedono infatti abilità, motivazioni e conoscenze specifiche. In questo contributo descriveremo COMPASS (Didactic Competences in the Multilingual Classroom), un’iniziativa di ricerca e formazione inserita nel progetto A scuola con più lingue (SMS 2.0) promosso da Eurac Research. L’iniziativa si propone di sostenere team di docenti delle scuole primarie di lingua italiana e tedesca nel valorizzare la crescente eterogeneità linguistica delle loro classi, e di accompagnarli nel loro percorso verso una pratica didattica plurilingue ancor più inclusiva che non si limiti solo a saltuari progetti sulla diversità. Nel nostro contributo, forniremo dapprima una nostra visione delle competenze (qui intese come abilità, motivazioni e conoscenze) che i docenti coinvolti nell’educazione plurilingue inclusiva dovrebbero possedere. Descriveremo poi brevemente le due componenti principali dell’iniziativa COMPASS, vale a dire un percorso biennale di formazione e uno studio di ricerca longitudinale sullo sviluppo delle competenze e delle pratiche didattiche dei/delle docenti coinvolti nell’iniziativa. In ultimo presenteremo alcuni dei risultati preliminari relativi a un team (20 docenti) di una delle scuole partecipanti all’iniziativa. I risultati, ottenuti dall’analisi di dati raccolti durante il primo anno di formazione tramite interviste individuali semi-strutturate e una intervista focus group, sottolineano l’importanza di creare momenti di riflessione e scambio tra insegnanti, così come tra insegnanti e ricercatori/trici. Essi evidenziano inoltre il ruolo cruciale delle motivazioni e degli atteggiamenti degli/delle insegnanti nello sviluppo e normalizzazione di pratiche didattiche plurilingui inclusive.   Linguistic pluralism in schools and teaching skills: experiences from South Tyrol   In South Tyrol, institutional trilingualism (German, Italian, Ladin) and diglossia coexist with new languages and varieties brought into the territory through migration flows. The increasing linguistic and cultural diversity in the Province of Bozen/Bolzano has a strong impact on everyday school life and poses new challenges for teachers: the inclusion and valorisation of all the linguistic resources that students bring into the classroom, as well as the mobilisation of their entire linguistic repertoires for learning, in fact, require a set of skills, attitudes and knowledge. In this contribution we will describe COMPASS (Didactic Competences in the Multilingual Classroom), a research and training initiative included in the project One school, many languages (SMS 2.0) promoted by Eurac Research. The initiative aims to support teams of primary school teachers in making the most of the increasing linguistic heterogeneity of their classes, and to accompany them towards the adoption of a more inclusive approach to plurilingual education that extends beyond sporadic projects on diversity. In our contribution, we will focus in particular on the motivational dimension of the competences that we deem necessary to teach in linguistically-diverse classrooms. A prominent role in this contribution is therefore given to the concept of teachers’ beliefs, in other words the complex and dynamic set of attitudes and beliefs that motivate a teacher to activate their knowledge and didactic skills so as to promote more inclusive forms of plurilingual education. Focusing on this dimension of teacher competence, in this contribution we will first describe the two components of the COMPASS initiative, i.e. a two-year professional development course and a longitudinal research study on the development of teacher competences for plurilingual education. Subsequently, we will discuss some of the preliminary findings related to one participating team (20 teachers). Drawing on the analysis of data collected during the first year of professional development through individual semi-structured interviews and a focus group, the discussion will highlight the importance of fostering moments of reflection and exchange between teachers, as well as between teachers and researchers. It will also show the crucial role of teachers’ motivations and attitudes in the promotion and normalisation of inclusive plurilingual didactic practices.},

 abstract = {The study explores the role of ChatGPT in the development of a micro-level framework for Educational Technology (EdTech). This study employed an inductive research design particularly a Constructivist Grounded Theory (CGT) approach from thirty-four private secondary high school teachers in the Philippines. To gather insights from specific participants, a semi-structured interview format was utilized. The instrument went through face validation from two experts well-versed in education research, instrumentation, and three-stage prompts. In addition, using JAMOVI software, Fleiss’ Kappa was used with a value of 0.715 indicating a substantial agreement among the expert validators. The interviews were designed to be open-ended, allowing for a flexible exploration of the research topic then subjected for data analysis with the aid of QDA Miner lite software. The findings revealed three (3) distinct milieux: pedagogical support, professional development, and ethical sense. In the (a) pedagogical support milieu, ChatGPT emerges as a virtual compass, offering real-time assistance, explanations, and guidance for teachers. It demonstrates the capability to answer questions, clarify concepts, and provide step-by-step support, crafted to individual students’ needs and learning styles; within the (b) redesigning milieu, it serves as a catalyst for adapting and recalibrating assessment and teaching strategies to suit learning purpose; and (c) ethical sense milieu highlights various implications, including data privacy, plagiarism, transparency, accountability, and overly reliant to the AI tool. Thus, this paper offers a micro-level framework anchored to the ChatGPT’s role in EdTech and aims to stimulate further scholarly discourse in the field.},

 abstract = { The purpose of the study . The paper analyzes the content оf the concept of “general cultural competence of a future teacher” and its dialectical development in a changing world under the influence of various factors: the new technological order; the complexity and diversity of various social environments; the risks of environmental, energy and epidemic crises; the emergence of artificial intelligence and learning neural networks; and the large consequences of small (at first glance) events in public life. The authors of this paper identified the inseparable connection of the general cultural competence of a future teacher with the general culture of human society. The work culture (professional activity) of a teacher is understood as an intellectual, socially oriented creative activity in the field of education, which has a spiritual ground and value sense. Such professional activity includes imperatives of personal and professional development, learning new things, motivation to participate in the life and upbringing of the subjects of their work – students. The trend of pragmatism in the development of educational programs of higher education, underestimation of the humanistic function of pedagogical universities and the need to form longitudinal professional and life goals of graduates is actualized.     Materials and methods . The study is based on the analysis of scientific publications in the field of competence-based, culturological and learner-centered approaches in pedagogy. The content of publications was compared, and the frequency of key terms in these publications was analyzed using the online service “Semantic text analysis online, seo text analysis”.   The results of the study. The results prove that the phenomenon of culture arises in the process of human coevolution. In this study, the structure and content of culture is seen as a sphere with three poles (religion, art, science). In the process of historical increase in the volume of culture, these poles could have changed mutual distances, demonstrating a prevailing influence of each pole on the volume of the culture sphere. Furthermore, the series of categories of “cult – culture – general cultural competence of a future teacher” was analyzed. In the context of the competency-based approach, an analysis of the content of the concept “general cultural competence of a future teacher” is considered. It has been suggested that leadership competence can be considered as part of the general cultural competence of a future teacher, determining the ability to independently organize his or her own professional and life trajectory from the position of a leader, creating an atmosphere of cooperation in the pedagogical, design or research process. The leader's worldview is seen to be an integral part of the general culture of a person, being realized in the normative (regulatory) and evaluative (axiological) functions of the culture, as well as in the socialization function together with a continuous desire for self-improvement in the profession and life.   Conclusion. The findings of the study demonstrate that teachers, as carriers and subjects of culture, need to develop their general cultural competence to navigate in and adapt to a changing world. The considered competences are crucial in the modern conditions and should be directly or indirectly introduced into the future Federal State Educational Standards of Higher Education in the Russian Federation. },

 abstract = {The content of the article emphasizes the importance of training teachers of natural and mathematical fields to use artificial intelligence in their professional activities and developing their competencies to prepare students for modern challenges and opportunities provided by this technology. The analysis of scientific and methodical literature made it possible to determine the advantages and disadvantages of using AI in the educational process of institutions of general secondary education and to propose directions for improving the qualifications of teachers of natural sciences and mathematics. The use of artificial intelligence in science and mathematics education has the potential to improve student achievement outcomes and provide a more personalized learning experience, but with consideration of the potential risks and limitations of artificial intelligence in education, such as the risk of over-reliance on technology, data security. The analysis of the results of the survey of teachers confirms the readiness of science and mathematics teachers for professional development, mastery of advanced training programs for the use of AI. A necessary condition for the introduction of AI is the alignment of the artificial intelligence model with the vision of teachers regarding education, in particular the possibilities of achieving educational goals, alignment with advanced practices in education. The definition of artificial intelligence tools for the science and mathematics field of general secondary education based on the introduction of theoretical research methods made it possible to generalize the directions of professional development of teachers of mathematics and science fields on the implementation of AI and to form the content lines of the educational and professional program of teacher training. The study considers the importance and directions of training teachers for the use of artificial intelligence in postgraduate education and highlights ideas and approaches that will help to effectively introduce these technologies into the educational process, contributing to the improvement of the quality of education and the preparation of the younger generation for the challenges of the future.  },

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence is one of the leading technologies today, which is rapidly spreading into all spheres of human activities including education. In 2023, GPT chat was ranked fourth in the Top 100 Tools for Learning rating, which demonstrates the powerful potential of artificial intelligence tools for the development of innovative processes in education. Accordingly, educators need to understand what artificial intelligence is, its features, and how it can be used to replace the routine activities of both teachers and students in teaching and learning. The authors conducted a survey of primary school teachers about their understanding of this notion, ways to use it as their assistant, advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence, and prospects for its development and application in all areas of human activity. The level of respondents' knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence, its features and functions was determined. The professional standard of a primary school teacher and the types of activities, through which the teacher's labor functions are realized and for which it is advisable to use artificial intelligence tools, are analyzed. The development of primary school teachers' competencies can be positively influenced by the use of artificial intelligence in their professional activities. The authors describe digital artificial intelligence tools that will be useful for primary school teachers and classify them according to the types of their pedagogical activities. The areas of activity in which artificial intelligence can act as a teacher's assistant, as well as areas that are currently beyond the capabilities of artificial intelligence, are identified. It is concluded that primary school teachers need to be trained to use artificial intelligence in their professional activities and to transfer knowledge about artificial intelligence to pupils, as well as ways to teach pupils the features of artificial intelligence, methods of its application for teaching pupils and for their own professional development.},

@article{pub.1168678874,
 abstract = {Abstract Even though artificial intelligence (AI) is no new occurrence, with its beginnings dating back to the 1950s, its use has gained popularity worldwide, especially in recent years, and its presence and importance has grown in many areas of human lives, including education. Surveys conducted internationally have found generally positive attitudes of university students towards artificial intelligence (AI) and its inclusion into various fields of research and study. However, only few research probes have been conducted among students of philology and future language teachers. No such research has been conducted among university students or pre-service EFL teachers in Central Europe. This paper aims to fill this gap in educational research knowledge, as knowing teachers’ and teacher students’ attitudes towards AI can be a key factor in the success or failure of applying AI in education. Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine the level of knowledge and dominant attitudes towards AI in general, AI in learning/teaching EFL and the inclusion of AI in the teacher training curriculum among pre-service EFL teachers in Slovakia. To collect data from the respondents, a cross-sectional survey in the form of a KAP questionnaire was conducted in November-December 2022. 137 pre-service English language teachers responded to a pre-tested online questionnaire consisting of 19 closed-ended (5-point Likert scale) items and one open-ended question. Slovak EFL pre-service teachers were equally interested (38.67%) and uninterested (39.42%) in the ongoing discussion about AI in education. Overall, they self-reported having no (61.31%) or unsatisfactory (21.17%) understanding of the basic computational principles of AI. On the other hand, they were significantly more satisfied with their knowledge of AI-based applications for EFL teaching, which they considered adequate (35.04%). Nevertheless, almost half of the students (45.25%) rated their knowledge as inadequate. It was therefore encouraging to learn that 64.24% of the respondents agreed that AI education should be included in their university curriculum and had predominantly positive expectations of AI and its application in education. 63.50% of them agreed with the statement that AI will improve education in general (compared to only 18.98% who disagreed). They shared a predominantly positive attitude towards the incorporation of AI into EFL and showed their optimistic expectations regarding the impact of AI on teaching and learning English as a foreign language. Slovak EFL pre-service teachers did not express any concerns about the future of their profession. However, a majority of them (53.28%) agreed that EFL teachers might lose some of their skills when using AI in their practice and a significant number (42.33%) feared that AI would make EFL teaching less personal. These findings are consistent with previous research conducted internationally.},
